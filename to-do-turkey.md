# Recipie: Spatchcock, Herb-Rubbed Turkey

Cook 80-90 mins at 425 then rest for 20 mins & carve

We want an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast to register 150°F, and the thighs register at least 165°F.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 4 tbsp flour
- butter

## Gravy pt 1

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 3 quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Roughly chop the neck, backbone, and giblets. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, another 5 minutes.

Add chicken stock, remaining thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Allow to cook 45 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh strainer into a 2 quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from the surface of the broth.

#### Gravy pt 2

Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2 quart saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until flour is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add broth in a thin, steady stream until it it all incorporated. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to about 1 quart, about 20 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep gravy warm.

#### Turkey pt 2 : carving & gravy pt3

Remove from oven and allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Serve immediately.

When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from out of the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and dicard. Whisk juices into gravy.

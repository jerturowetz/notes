## RiNo street art

- “Reverberations” – Trippy, concentric circles comprised of geometric patterns overtake an otherworldly landscape in this pulsating piece by Damon Soule and Justin Lovato. Find it on the _east side of Larimer, between 25th and 26th streets_.
- “Larimer Boy and Girl” – Artist Jeremy Burns’ clever use of a building’s extruding fins means you can only observe the complete image by walking toward it from a distance. Go one way and you’ll see a boy with a surprised expression; go the other to see a melancholy girl. It’s located at _27th and Larimer_.
- Vyal One tackled a massive project when he adorned the entire building at 27th and Walnut in hallucinogenic orbs and eyeballs. The result is electric. Located at _2668 Walnut St._

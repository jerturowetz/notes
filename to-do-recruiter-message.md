Hey there, thanks for the communication.

Before we go any further please note that I am happy to treat new opportunities seriously and graciously. In return, I ask that you thoroughly review my qualifications and make certain they match the position you're communicating with me about.

Straight-talk: I don't like recruiters who dont care about talent or are just playing a game of numbers. I take my time very seriously. Please don't ask me to give up my time without first properly verifying that I'm suited for a particular position.

On the flipside, if you do your homework and treat my time with respect you'll find out that I'm quite loyal. Presenting me with good opportunities, whether I take them or not, will lead me to promote your services to my friends and colleagues and stick with you throughout my career.

Beyond the technical skills listed on my profile, here are a few questions that can help speed along the process:

- Is the position you're communicating with me about bilingual? My spoken French is solid but I'm not comfortable emailing, issuing reports or commenting code in French.
- Is the position at a office on the island of Montreal relatively close to a Metro station? Is it remote?
- Is this a contract or a full time position?
- What is the value or value range of the contract/position?
- What's the name of the company? Is it a public company? What is their primary industry/product?
- If not already attached, is there a job posting you can provide or link me?

Have a good one!
Jer

# Jeremy's To-Do List


Despite the fact that we're not bringing the baby to a bar every day, we've gone out enough since his birth and you're the first establishment to enforce the law with us and it feels that by doing so, out of fear of repercussion or otherwise, you're making a statement about parents.

Remember we're talking about a baby here. Unless you're seriously telling me that inspectors have given citations for children under the age of 2 (which I have a hard time believing as judges in Quebec tend not to appreciate US style quibbling and I can't imagine a judge would hold up a 7 month old as a potential consumer of alcohol)

deployments

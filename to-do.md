### Wedding:: Notes

- Our eloi deposit is due 8 August, we can pay by e-trans, paypal or mail a cheque. If we do electronic we use aurelia@eloi.ca (double check my spelling)
- Our studio comes with access to 3 tables blanches, 1 larger table & 2 sofas. They also rent 8x30 tables (I believe collapsible) for $10 each, there are 15 available 
- There are also 100 plain black folding chairs which we can rent
- There is apparently a big reno going on from now until the end of June, after which there should be wheelchair access straight to the 5th floor. We can call back by end of June to review/confirm (construction crews)
- We can have light music (like a band) on the terrace until 11PM, and maybe even a quiet stereo later than that.
- There are large lights on the terrasse, but not string lights; though there should be plenty of plugs
- There is a little stereo system we can rent for $50, has a small mic and such (she'll be sending the model #). While not great for the dance portion, it'll probably be a good 2nd system for outside.

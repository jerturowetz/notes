## Randoms

Grilled cheese
Bran muffins
Fresh fruit (i.e cantaloupe wedges with strawberries and yogurt)


Either the brussel sprouts or the string beans. I wouldn't do both since you'll have your hands full on the stove. But if you wanted a second veg, roasted carrots with cumin seeds are delicious.
If there is a vegan, I would go with a high protein starch, maybe by combining different grains.  And then do a veggie side
Like sauteed string beans with garlic, butter/oil and bread crumbs
Or shredded sauteed brussel sprouts.
Is there a vegan/vegetarian among you?
Because sauteed brussel sprouts are pretty fucking badass when you add a bit of bacon.....
And it goes really well with roast chicken and mashed potatoes. But so do the sauteed string beens
Oh my word I think I'm gonna make this for dinner tonight

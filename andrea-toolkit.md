# Home toolkit for life

I'm a big fan of buying things for life. It's great when products don't break but it's also nice to be able to sell things on Kijiji/marketplace if you ever decided to, which you can't really do with cheap stuff.

I didnt really put any links to specific products unless I feel strongly about them but if you want direction on specific items let me know and I'll give you my 2 cents. I'd invite you to do your own research & also check Kijiji for used stuff to save some $$$. Tool marketing can be pretty daunting but most of the stuff on the shelf is OK and you dont need to get what's "best" as long as it's from a reputable brand.

## Tool storage

I'd recommend 2, maybe 3 storage containers for peace of mind:

- A basic [toolbox](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/tools/tool-storage/tool-boxes.html) or [tool bag](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/tools/tool-storage/tool-bags.html)
- [A small parts organizer](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/tools/tool-storage/small-parts-organizers.html) for storing screws, anchors and fasteners
- A bin for bulkier items (a milk crate will do)

I use the [ridgid system (because it's cheap and sturdy)](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/brands/ridgid/tools/tool-storage/tool-boxes.html/1009956.html.html), but it's very, very bulky and doesn't provide as good orbnaization as the slimmer/slightly more expensive [Millwaukee stuff](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/milwaukee-tool-packout-22-inch-tool-box-l/1001242092).

A few tips: A bin works better than just putting your buly items on a closet shelf because you can drag it from room to room as you work on projects. Those little cases for drill bits take up a lot of space so either get a toolbox to accomodate them or store them in the bin with your drills. Boxes that clip together arent necessary but makes moving stuff from room to room easier; however, because you're a bit smaller, a bunch of boxes clamped together might be too bulky to carry. In that case, lighter seperate items might be best or a system that has a bin with wheels if you want the whole system to be joinable.

## Important power tools

Pick a system and stick with it! Batteries are expensive so it helps to only get 1 charger and use a consistent battery system so that your tools are all compatible with each other. An 18v (not 12v) system guarantees more power and are generally more robustly built tools (if a bit heavier). I use the [18v Makita line](), but the Dewalt & Milwaukee lines are similar and about as good.

# Home toolkit for life

I'm a big fan of buying things for life. It's great when products don't break but it's also nice to be able to sell things on Kijiji/marketplace if you ever decided to, which you can't really do with cheap stuff.

I didnt really put any links to specific products unless I feel strongly about them but if you want direction on specific items let me know and I'll give you my 2 cents. I'd invite you to do your own research & also check Kijiji for used stuff to save some $$$. Tool marketing can be pretty daunting but most of the stuff on the shelf is OK and you dont need to get what's "best" as long as it's from a reputable brand.

## Tool storage

I'd recommend 2, maybe 3 storage containers for peace of mind:

- A basic [toolbox](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/tools/tool-storage/tool-boxes.html) or [tool bag](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/tools/tool-storage/tool-bags.html)
- [A small parts organizer](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/categories/tools/tool-storage/small-parts-organizers.html) for storing screws, anchors and fasteners
- A bin for bulkier items (a milk crate will do)

I use the [ridgid system (because it's cheap and sturdy)](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/brands/ridgid/tools/tool-storage/tool-boxes.html/1009956.html.html), but it's very, very bulky and doesn't provide as good orbnaization as the slimmer/slightly more expensive [Millwaukee stuff](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/milwaukee-tool-packout-22-inch-tool-box-l/1001242092).

A few tips: A bin works better than just putting your bulky items on a closet shelf because you can drag it from room to room as you work on projects. Those little cases for drill bits take up a lot of space so either get a toolbox to accomodate them or store them in the bin with your drills. Boxes that clip together arent necessary but makes moving stuff around easier; however, because you're a bit smaller, a bunch of boxes clamped together might be too bulky to carry. In that case, lighter seperate items might be best or a system that has a bin with wheels if you want the whole system to be joinable.

## Big stuff

Bigger items I haven't been able to live without

A small, folding step stool or step ladder: you wanna be able to reach up above curtain rods, over door frames and ceeiling mounted lights.
A small vaccum: A shop vac is great as you shouldnt be vaccuming up drywall dust with a normal vaccum (that is very bad for the vaccum).

## The most important power tool

- Power drill(s): if you're only getting one drill, get a hammer drill so that you can take on brick & concrete if you need to. They are heavier though, so a lightweight drill and a heavier hammer drill are a nice combo to have.

More and more tools today are battery powered which is very convenient, but batteries can get expensive, so it helps to buy all your battery-powered tools from the same family so you can use the same batteries for all your tools. I use the [18v Makita line](https://www.makitatools.com/lxtadvantage), but the Dewalt & Milwaukee lines are similar and are as good.

## Power tools for specific use cases

- Random orbital sander (really nice if you're gonna make your own shelves or need to strip and patch holes)
- Multitool (useful for cutting electrical box spaces or cutting mouldings)
- Circular saw (this is a dangerous tool so only buy one if youre gonna practice often, otherwise just get your wood cut at Home depot, it's cheap. f you do buy a circular saw, go with corded, not battery powered, you'll save $150).

if you buy a circular saw you'll probably also want to buy an insulation panel to cut on top of.

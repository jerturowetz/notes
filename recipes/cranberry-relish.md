## Grocery list

- Sugar
- Cranberry juice
- Ginger
- Ground cinnamon
- 16 oz fresh cranberries
- 1 orange

## Ingredients

- 1 cups granulated sugar (can add a bit)
- 1/2 cup cranberry juice
- 1/2 tsp fresh grated ginger
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 16 ounce bag fresh cranberries
- Zest of 1 orange â€“ just the orange part

## Directions

In a colander, rinse and pick over the cranberries to remove any mushy ones

In a large, heavy saucepan, add sugar, juice, cinnamon and grated ginger

Cook until sugar dissolves, syrup is clear and comes to a rolling boil (about 3 minutes)

Add cranberries to boiling syrup and continue cooking, uncovered, just until they begin to pop, about 2-5 minutes.  Be careful not to cook them too long or they will get mushy.

Skim the foam off the surface with a metal spoon and discard

Remove from heat, stir in orange zest and cool to room temperature, uncovered

Place in container, cover and store in the fridge for up to 3 months

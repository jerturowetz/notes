### Dressing & salad

- 1/3 cup hummus (or store-bought)
- 2 tbsp maple syrup (plus more to taste)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1-2 Tbsp hot water (to thin)
- 1 head roughly chopped romaine lettuce (or sub 1 bundle kale)

### Buffalo Chickpeas

- 15-ounce can chickpeas (1 & 1/4 cups) (rinsed, drained and dried)
- 1 tbsp coconut oil (grape seed or olive oil is fine)
- 4 tbsp hot sauce divided (Louisiana’s Pure Crystal Hot Sauce)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder (or 1 minced garlic clove)
- 1 pinch sea salt

### Serving

- 3-4 flour tortillas, pita, or flatbread
- 1/4 cup red onion, diced
- 1/4 cup baby tomato, diced
- 1/4 ripe avocado, thinly sliced

## Preparation

Add hummus, maple syrup, and lemon juice to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add hot water until thick but pourable. Taste and season as needed. Toss with greens & set aside.

In a medium bowl, mix chickpeas, oil, 3 tbsp hot sauce, garlic & pinch of salt - toss to coat.

Heat a metal or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add chickpeas and sauté for 3-5 minutes, mashing a few chickpeas gently with a spoon to create texture.

Remove from heat and add remaining 1 Tbsp hot sauce, stir to combine & set aside.

To assemble, top each wrap with a generous portion of the dressed romaine salad, and top with 1/4 cup buffalo chickpeas and a sprinkle of diced tomatoes, avocado, and/or onion (optional).

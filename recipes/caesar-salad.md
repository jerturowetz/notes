# Recipe : Caesar salad

You can make it in advance, even the day before, but keep it refrigerated because of the egg. Allowing some sit time will afford you the opportunity to re-season or add more garlic, Dijon, red wine vinegar or lemon.

## Ingredients

- 1 egg yolk
- Salt
- Pepper
- 2-3 medium cloves of chopped garlic
- 1/4+ cup of Dijon
- 1 1/2 cups Crisco vegetable oil or extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice
- Homemade bacon bits
- Croutons tossed in bacon fat and butter
- Parmesan cheese

Traditional Caesar salad also includes a tsp. or two of chopped anchovies or a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Both versions are good but some people don't like the anchovy taste.

## Directions

- Put egg yolk, garlic, salt, pepper, half the Dijon mustard and chopped anchovies or Worcestershire sauce in a bowl
- Slowly add the oil while whisking (about a 1/4 max at a time - just enough so the dressing maintains a mayonnaise-like consistency)
- Whisk in red wine vinegar or lemon juice
- Taste & whisk in more Dijon, salt, garlic, red wine vinegar or lemon juice if using that
- Toss your salad while adding croutons, cheese, bacon bits and anchovies - be careful with the dressing as it's easy to add too much
- Add more cheese on top after mixing

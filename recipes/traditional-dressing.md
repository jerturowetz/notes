[Original post](https://www.averiecooks.com/classic-traditional-thanksgiving-stuffing/)

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, divided in 4
- 1 pound day-old white French bread, torn or diced into 1/2-inch cubes and dried
- 1 extra-large (about 2 1/2 cups) sweet Vidalia or yellow onion, diced small
- 1 1/2 cups celery, diced small
- 2/3 cup Italian flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely minced
- 1/4 cup fresh sage leaves, finely minced
- 3 tablespoons fresh rosemary (sticks discarded), finely minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme (sticks discarded), finely minced
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon pepper, or to taste
- 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided in 2
- 2 large eggs

## Directions

### Day before

- Preheat oven to 250°F
- Place cubed bread on a baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, about 45 minutes
- Leave uncovered on the counter uncovered until the morning you’re ready to make the stuffing.

### Day of

Whisk 1 1/4 cups broth and eggs in a small bowl. Add to bread mixture; fold gently until thoroughly combined. Transfer to prepared dish, cover with foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of dressing registers 160°, about 40 minutes.

Bake dressing, uncovered, until set and top is browned and crisp, 40-45 minutes longer (if chilled, add 10-15 minutes).

- Preheat oven to 350° & spray a 9×13-inch pan or 3-quart baking dish with cooking spray; set aside
- Place bread in large bowl; set aside
- In a large skillet, melt 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) of butter over medium-high heat
- Stirring frequently, add the onions & celery and cook until vegetables are just beginning to brown (~10 min)
- Transfer vegetables to bowl with bread
- Add parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, salt (to taste, depends on broth saltiness), pepper (to taste)
- Drizzle in 1 1/4 cups chicken broth, toss gently but well; set aside to cool
- In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/4 cups chicken broth and 2 eggs. Drizzle mixture over bread and toss well to combine.
- Pour in to baking dish
- Dice the remaining 1/4 cup (half of 1 stick) butter into 8 to 10 pieces and evenly dot the butter over the top of the stuffing
- Cover with foil and bake until instant-read thermometer reads 160°, about 40 minutes
- Uncover and bake for an additional 40 to 45 minutes, or until top is as lightly golden browned as desired
- Serve immediately

### Cooking notes

You could stop right before uncovered baking and refrigerate and finish the rest later. If you do, add 10-15 minutes to the final baking step.

Stuffing is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days.

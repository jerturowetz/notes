est gravy recipe I've ever made: Alton Brown's Good Gravy

This recipe is not posted anywhere that I can find. He tweeted it out in his classic fashion - hand-written on sticky notes, photographed and posted - a couple of years ago for Thanksgiving. It's the easiest, most versatile gravy method I've ever found.

Here it is with my personal tweaks.

2oz clarified butter (or other whole cooking fat or oil)

2tsp fresh thyme leaves

2tsp finely chopped fresh sage

1oz potato starch

1oz all-purpose flour

1qt low sodium chicken broth

1Tbsp low sodium soy sauce

fresh nutmeg (optional)

1 tsp balsamic vinegar (optional)

Melt clarified butter in a large sauce pan over medium heat.

Fry the thyme and sage in the butter until fragrant, roughly 1 minute.

Add the flour, cook for 1 minute or until the mixture smells nutty, then add the potato starch and stir to combine.

Slowly add the chicken broth and soy sauce to the pan, whisking to combine and eliminate any lumps.

Bring the mix to a simmer and cook until thickened slightly, roughly 5 minutes.

Finish with optional nutmeg & balsamic vinegar for a brighter, hollandaise-like flavor.

The best part is you can customize it however you like. Use beef stock, change the vinegars around, use different herbs, add some cream or solids, etc. I've made an amazing sausage gravy by just following this recipe, using the oil from the browning the sausage, doubling the sage, swapping thyme for rosemary, and then adding the browned sausage crumbles at the end.

I have to hide the spoons when there's a pot of this on the stove (mostly from myself), it's that good.

That sounds like a great recipe, but 1/2 tsp seems like a ton of nutmeg for 1 quart of gravy. Personally, I think I'd end up reducing it to 1/4 tsp or 1/8. Probably fine during the holiday season, though.

If I was making this into sausage gravy, I think I'd nix the nutmeg and use 1/8-1/4 tsp ground celery seed.

You're probably right. I rarely use the nutmeg, but when I do it's usually just a few quick grates over the pot.. I can't remember what the original version called for, actually.

Good call on the celery seed for the sausage gravy!

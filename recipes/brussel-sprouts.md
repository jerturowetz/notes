# Recipe : Easy roast brussel sprouts

Making turkey? These things make a great side. Even better: they take about 20 mins to cook (which is how long the turket needs to rest).

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds (675g) Brussels sprouts, trimmed and split in half
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

Adjust oven rack to upper position, place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on it, and preheat oven to 500Â°F.

Toss sprouts with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

Remove baking sheet from oven and add brussels sprouts, working quickly to turn them all cut-side-down. Return to oven and roast until tender and deeply browned, about 20 minutes total. Serve immediately.

# [Recipe : Simple Is Best Dressing](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simple-is-best-dressing)

Made this for 2019 thanksgiving dinner with Wade & Duncan. It was a hit, however it was way too much for 5 people. Reduce quantities if serving 5-6 people. If more, keep as is.

## Ingredients

- 1 & 1/2 sticks unsalted butter and a bit extra for the baking dish
- 2 loafs sourdough, torn and dried overnight
- 2 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions (~1 super big)
- 1 1/2 cups 1/4-inch slices celery (~ 4 stalks)
- 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley (1/3 head)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh savory
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided
- 3 large eggs

## Directions

### Pre prep

- Dry bread overnight and finish in a 250°F oven for about 1 hour.
- Let cool & transfer to a _very_ large bowl (a canning pot works too).

### Day of

- Preheat oven to 350°
- Butter a 13x9x2-inch baking dish and set aside
- Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add onions & celery. Stir often until beginning to brown (~ 10 mins).
- Add butter & veg to bowl with bread. Stir, adding in herbs, salt, and pepper.
- Drizzle in 1 1/4 cups broth and toss gently. Let cool.
- Whisk 1 1/4 cups broth and eggs in a small bowl
- Right before baking, gently fold eggs & broth mix with bread mixture until thoroughly combined.
- Transfer to prepared dish, cover with foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of dressing registers 160° (~40 mins).
- Remove tinfoil and finish uncovered for 5 mins

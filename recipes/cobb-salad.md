## Instructions

### Salad

In a large frying pan over medium heat, fry the bacon about 10 minutes or until crispy; transfer to paper towel to drain. Set aside.

Arrange the lettuce, watercress, eggs, bacon, blue cheese, avocados and tomatoes in rows on a platter.

### Dressing

In a small bowl, using a fork, mix in the egg yolks and Dijon mustard to make a paste. Whisk in the red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and maple syrup. While whisking, slowly drizzle in olive oil to form a thick dressing. Add water to loosen it up if necessary. Season with salt and pepper.

Pour the dressing over the salad just before serving.

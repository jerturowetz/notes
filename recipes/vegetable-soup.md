# Recipe : Alton Brown's vegetable soup

Cut up carrotts, celery, onions & mushrooms
Brown veg in a bit of oil
add 1/2 bottle of white wine
add sliced garlic
add water & simmer for 5 mins

add bay leaves & fresh thyme
simmer for 20 to 30

slice up the same veg and sweat them (med heat, don't brown them)
if making steamed asparagus throw the stems into the stock
throw in some lentils or brown rice
usually we use 2 parts liquid to 1 part rice (when doing lentils or brown)
but 'cause it's a soup we'll do - 3 to 4 parts in a soup
cherry vinegar or whatever
salt

frozen peas - frozen corn as a garnins (how the hell do I prepare this?  missed that part of the show... maybe just throw them in)

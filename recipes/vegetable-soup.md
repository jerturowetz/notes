**Prep Time:** 45 minutes
**Cook Time:** 1hr 45 minutes
**Yield:** 6 quarts

## Ingredients

- 2 tbs olive oil x2
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, halved and sliced (baby portobella or mushrooms of choice)
- 2 medium carrots, finely diced
- 2 celery ribs, finely diced
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 35 oz can whole tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons fresh sage, chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 & 1/2 quarts water
- 3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
- one piece parmesan rind (2x2 inch)
- 7 ounces butternut squash, cubed
- 5 ounces curly kale, chopped
- 2 (15 ounce) cans great northern beans, undrained
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- shaved parmesan cheese, for serving

## Directions

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in an 8-quart stockpot over high heat until shimmering.

Add mushrooms and saute until browned (5 mins). Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside.

Decrease heat to low, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the carrots, celery, onions and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened (30 minutes minimum).

Add canned tomatoes, sage, rosemary and garlic, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring to break up the tomatoes.

Add the water, soy sauce and Parmesan rind, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, (about 15 minutes).

Add the squash and kale, decrease the heat to low & cover and cook until tender (about 30 to 35 minutes).

Return the mushrooms to the pot along with the beans and red wine vinegar and cook until all is heated through (about 15 minutes).

Remove the cheese rind and serve warm with shaved Parmesan.

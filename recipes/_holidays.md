# Thanksgiving 2018

I made way too much food and there was a lot of waste but I did learn a few things:

- Turkey 1kg/2ppl is about right
- Don't double up on cranberry sauce just because there's more people
- Make fewer things
- Make simpler things

## 2018 super menu

This was the menu (for 14), not counting cheese, baguettes, olives & BBQ meatballs for when people arrived

- Turkey (6kg)
- Gravy
- Cranberry relish
- Dressing/stuffing
- Corn on the cob
- Mashed potatoes
- Brussel sprouts
- 2 trays roast veg
- Roast beets
- Tomato burrata salad
- Parsnip fritters w/garlic yogurt sauce
- Alton brown green bean casserole (trash)
- Sausage rolls
- Meat pies from TA
- Dinner rolls

### A better 2018 menu

This would still likely be a bit too much, but more under control.

- Turkey
- Gravy
- Cranberry relish
- Dressing/stuffing
- Corn on the cob
- Mashed potatoes
- Brussel sprouts
- 1 tray roast veg
- 2 dozen sausage rolls

## 2019 Menu for Wade & Duncan

This menu was really good, but we might have had one too many heavy veg dishes. We used a few carrots and 3 sweet potatoes, which were the weakest but most abundan item. I've adjusted the menu below to be perfect.

- Turkey
- ~Roast sweet potatoes & carrots~ 1/2 sheet Roast carrots & parsnips
- Pan fried brussel sprouts
- Stuffing
- Smashed potatoes
- Gravy
- Cranberry Jam (from Cathy)
- Fried mushrooms

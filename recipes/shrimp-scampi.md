## Ingredients

- 1 pound dry spaghettini or thin spaghetti
- 1 1/2 pounds peeled and deveined uncooked medium shrimp
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
- 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- Juice from 1/2 a medium lemon

## Instructions

Pat the shrimp dry and season both sides with salt and pepper.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 7 to 9 minutes, or according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, drain the pasta, and set aside.

In the same large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute.

Flip the shrimp and add the wine, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the shrimp are just opaque and the wine has reduced by half, about 2 minutes.

Remove the pot from the heat, add the butter cubes, and stir until melted. Add the pasta, parsley, and lemon juice. Toss, adding some of the reserved pasta water, tablespoon by tablespoon, to loosen the pasta and form a sauce that evenly coats the pasta. You might not use all the pasta water.

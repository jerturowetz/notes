# Recipe : Dry brining a turkey

## Ingredients

- Turkey
- 1/2 cup Kosher salt
- 2 tbsp Baking powder
- cheesecloth or plastic wrap

## Directions

Carefully pat your turkey dry with paper towels

Combine half a cup of kosher salt with two tablespoons of baking powder in a bowl

Generously sprinkle the salt mixture on all surfaces by picking up the mixture between your thumb and fingers, holding it six to 10 inches above the bird, and letting the mixture shower down over the surface of the turkey for even coverage. The turkey should be well coated with salt, though not completely encrusted.

_Warning: You will most likely not need all of the salt. In some cases, less than half will be okay; it depends on the size of your bird and your salt preferences._

Transfer the turkey to a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and refrigerate, uncovered, for 12 to 24 hours - if refrigerating for longer loosely cover turkey with plastic wrap or cheesecloth before refrigerating & let it rest for up to 3 days.

Without rinsing, roast using whatever recipie, omitting any additional salting steps called for in those recipes.

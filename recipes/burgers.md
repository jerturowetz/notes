# Recipe : Burgers

## Ingredients

- 80% to 85% lean ground beef (if you can, buy fresh from the butcher case)
- hamburger buns
- Butter or oil, for the pan
- Salt and pepper

### Toppings

- Cheese slices (cheddar, swiss, American, or provolone)
- Condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo, BBQ sauce, relish)
- Sliced veg (tomato, onions, lettuce)
- Pickles

### Meat calc

at 6oz ground chuck per burger & 16oz in a pound
6n/16 = lbs of raw meat needed where n is the number of burgers
e.g. 6*4/16 = 1.5lbs for 4 burgers

## Preperation

_Handling the beef will toughen it up, so the goal should be to resist over-shaping or over-handling._

Break the ground beef into rouch chunks (6oz each)

Shape the patties by gently pressing each chunk with the palm of your hand against the counter into a disk roughly an inch thick. Press the middle to create a shallow "dimple" (at most a quarter of an inch more shallow) and pat the edges into a round. Don't worry if there are some cracks in the edges; try not to mash the beef too much as you shape the patties

## Cooking

_Double-Batch of Burgers: If you're making burgers for a crowd, cook the burgers in batches and cook the burgers to just under the desired doneness level. Transfer the cooked burgers to a baking sheet and keep warm in a 300°F oven while you finish the rest of the batches._

Warm a flat pan over medium heat

Put a touch of butter or oil on the pan and toast the buns by pressing them in to the butter/oil

Increase the heat to medium-high & keep an eye on the pan. When you see the first wisp of smoke, you're ready to cook the burgers

Place the patties in the pan : they should sizzle when they hit it. Sprinkle the tops generously with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.

Slide a spatula under the burgers and flip to the other side. You should see a dark brown sear on the underside (if not, increase your heat next time). Sprinkle the other side generously with salt and pepper, and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes to your preferred doneness. If the burger falls apart when you flip, just press the edges together and carry on — your burger will still be great! If making cheeseburgers, top the burgers with cheese as soon as you flip them. If the cheese isn't melting fast enough, cover the pan with a lid or other dome to encourage the cheese to melt.

Ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees.

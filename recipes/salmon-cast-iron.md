# Recipie :: Cast iron salmon

The way I nromally do it (and it feels a bit overdone) is:

- Purposefully using thicker salmon
- Drying off the salmon with a paper towel
- covering with salt and pepper
- Putting the cast iron on med-high (like 7) for 5 mins
- throwing in butter (15s)
- Place salmon, skin up on the pan (3 mins)
- Peel skin off & flip
- reduce heat to almost-off (like 2) leave for (3 mins)
- remove from pan

# [Recipe: Spatchcock, Herb-Rubbed Turkey](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/how-to-spatchcock-cook-turkey-thanksgiving-fast-easy-way-spatchcocked-slideshow.html)

## PLAN AHEAD

Turkeys are an operation so good thing you're an operator! This will likely take about 90 mins of prep & 90 mins of cooking. The turkey also needs to rest for about 20 mins after you're done so get started 3 & 1/2 hours before you want to eat.

## Ingredients

Herb & butter quantities adjusted

- 1 turkey (12 to 14 pounds)
- 2 large yellow onions, 1 roughly chopped, the other peeled & halved
- 2 stalks celery, roughly chopped
- 1 large carrot, roughly chopped
- 8 sprigs thyme
- 6 medium cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup roughly chopped chives
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves
- 1/2 cup fresh sage leaves
- 2 medium shallot, thinly sliced
- 4 sticks butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

### Turkey pt 1

- Preheat oven to 425°F & adjust oven rack to middle-lower (as we want the bird in the middle - not the rack)

- Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil, add the chopped veg and some thyme stems. Place slotted broiler rack or wire rack on top

- Combine garlic, chives, parsley, sage, thyme, and shallots in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until finely chopped and no large pieces remain. Scatter butter chunks on top & pulse until homogenous paste is formed. Season generously with salt and pepper and pulse to combine (NO SALT IF YOU DID A SALT BRINE). Transfer 1/3 of butter mixture to a small saucepan and melt over low heat.

- Pat turkey dry with paper towels & spatchcock

- Rub butter mixture under turkey skin until distributed in an even layer. [Instructions here](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-food-lab-how-to-make-herb-butter-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-recipe.html)

- Brush exterior of the turkey with the melted butter until evenly coated & season with salt and pepper (NO SALT IF YOU DID A SALT BRINE).

- Transfer to the wire rack & tuck wings. Place halved onion under turkey.

- Bake for about 80 minutes, rotating occasionally (?). Cook until the deepest part of the breast is 150°F, and the thighs register 165°F.

- When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving.

- If you like, pour juices from the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and dicard. Whisk juices into gravy.

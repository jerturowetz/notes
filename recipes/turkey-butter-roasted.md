# [Recipe: Spatchcock, Herb-Rubbed Turkey](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/how-to-spatchcock-cook-turkey-thanksgiving-fast-easy-way-spatchcocked-slideshow.html)

Turkeys are an operation so good thing you're an operator! PLAN AHEAD: this will very likely take about 90 mins of prep & 90 mins of cooking. The turkey also needs to rest for about 20 mins after you're done so Get started 3 & 1/2 hours before you want to eat.

## Ingredients

Herb & butter quantities adjusted

- 1 turkey (12 to 14 pounds?)
- 3 large yellow onions, 2 roughly chopped, the other peeled & halved
- 4 stalks celery, roughly chopped
- 3 large carrots, roughly chopped
- 12 sprigs thyme
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 6 medium cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup roughly chopped chives
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves
- 1/2 cup fresh sage leaves
- 2 medium shallot, thinly sliced
- 4 sticks butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken or turkey broth
- 4 tbsp flour

## Directions

### Turkey pt 1

- Preheat oven to 425°F & adjust oven rack to middle-lower (as we want the bird in the middle - not the rack)

- Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil, add 2/3rds of the chopped veg and some thyme stems. Place slotted broiler rack or wire rack on top

- Combine garlic, chives, parsley, sage, thyme, and shallots in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until finely chopped and no large pieces remain. Scatter butter chunks on top & pulse until homogenous paste is formed. Season generously with salt and pepper and pulse to combine (NO SALT IF YOU DID A SALT BRINE). Transfer 1/3 of butter mixture to a small saucepan and melt over low heat.

- Pat turkey dry with paper towels & spatchcock

- Rub butter mixture under turkey skin until distributed in an even layer. [Instructions here](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-food-lab-how-to-make-herb-butter-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-recipe.html)

- Brush exterior of the turkey with the melted butter until evenly coated & season with salt and pepper (NO SALT IF YOU DID A SALT BRINE).

- Transfer to the wire rack & tuck wings. Place halved onion under turkey.

- Bake for about 80 minutes, rotating occasionally (?). Cook until the deepest part of the breast is 150°F, and the thighs register 165°F.

### Gravy pt 1

- Roughly chop the neck, backbone, and giblets.

- Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 3 quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned (~ 5 mins).

- Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots (~ 5 mins).

- Add chicken stock, remaining thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer.

- Allow to cook 45 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh strainer into a 2 quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from the surface of the broth.

### Gravy pt 2

- Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2 quart saucepan
- Add flour, whisking constantly, until flour is golden brown (~ 3 mins)
- Still whisking, add broth in a thin, steady stream until it it all incorporated
- Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer
- Cook until reduced to about 1 quart (~ 20 mins)

### Turkey pt 2/gravy pt3

When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving.

Pour juices from the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and dicard. Whisk juices into gravy.

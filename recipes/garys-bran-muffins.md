# Recipe : Gary's bran muffins

**Note:** you can double the quantities for a double batch

## Ingredients

### Dry stuff

- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 & 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Wet stuff

- 1 & 1/4 cup all bran flakes
- 1 cup buttermilk (or reg milk with a cap of vinegar)
- 1/3 cup canola oil
- 1 egg beaten with a fork

## Instructions

For the record, it's easy to let the bran sit overnight, preheat the oven when you wake up and then quickly mix together the rest for early morning muffins

- Put milk in all bran and let sit at least 15 minutes or overnight.
- Stir dry ingredients together in a separate bowl
- Add oil and egg to all bran and milk and mix by hand
- Add dry ingredients to wet and mix by hand
- Put in greased muffin tins and bake at 400 for 15 minutes
- Let cool in muffin tins on wire rack for a minute or two and then carefully remove to finish cooling on wire rack

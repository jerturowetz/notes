[Original source](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-diy-instant-noodle-cups-222560#_)

The ingredents listed below are more suggestions than a hard line (use pork, tofu, turkey instead of chicken, use fresh corn instead of frozen veg, etc)

## Ingredients (per soup)

- 1 full tsp better than boiuillion
- 1/2 tsp chili garlic sauce
- 1/2 cup pre-cooked room temp frozen veg
- 1/4 cup pulled chicken
- noodles or rice
- fresh green veg (green onion, cilantro)

## Preparation

As the hot water will not cook any of the ingredients so everything needs to be pre-cooked. You can however half-cook some items so that the hot water can finish the job/so that they dont get soggy (frozen veg & pasta noodles as examples).

Be sure to use cold water to halt the cooking process on anything half cooked.

Anyway, after pre-cooking stuff, de-boning and pulling apart any meat, assemble soupd by layering the following in a wide mouth mason jar:

- Base & extra flavor sauce
- vegetables
- protein
- noodles (stuff to the top, dont worry if they stick)
- fresh greens

Close the jar and refridgerate

### Before consuming

- Fill to the top with hot/boiing water
- Let steep for 3 minutes
- Stir/shake well until all the flavor on the bottom is mixed in

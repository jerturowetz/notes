# Recipe: Roast pork with crackling

[](https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/05/feed-a-crowd-with-this-thai-inspired-roast-pork-shoulder-feast.html)

Great sides for this are Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, green vegetables and apple sauce

## Ingredients

Look for a joint with plenty of fat under the skin. A 2kg rolled loin is enough to serve six people with plenty for sandwiches later.

Although convenient, rolled joints are also hard to make crackle, especially where the skin meets the roasting tin. Don’t despair, though; you can still make it work with a bit of preparation.

## Preparation

### The day before

- The day before you eat, dry the skin of your pork thoroughly with paper kitchen towels.
- Even if your butcher has already scored it, score the pork well using a craft knife on cold skin. Scoring lines should be about half a centimetre apart.
- Rub salt into the skin, as if the pork were somebody you are particularly fond of who is demanding a lovely exfoliating massage.
- Take a hairdryer to the skin of the meat until it’s absolutely bone dry
- Wrap the joint in a teatowel and refrigerate it overnight

### The day of

- Remove from fridge and let sit 20 mins
- Rub some more salt into the skin, making sure it gets through the cracks where you scored it and into the fat
- Put a bed of onions at the bottom of a metal roasting dish and rest the pork on top of it
- Over high heat, melt goose fat and pour searing hot fat over the skin
- Place pork in over at 425°F for 15 mins
- Lower the heat to 180°C and cook the joint for two hours, basting every 20 minutes
- Turn the heat back up to 425 for a final 15 mins (this will create teh crackle, leave a few extra mins if necess)
- Remove from oven and let rest for ten minutes in a warm place
- Remove the carapace of crackling, carve the meat and divide the splintering crackling between the plates

# Let's get married

August 18th-19th
August 25th-26th
Sept 8th-9th

Hi there,

I'm curious to know if you offered rentals of the camp for weddings, as I'm planning mine for this summer and was looking to do something a little more relaxed (ceremony by the lake, some swimming, etc.).

If so, the dates we are considering are August 18th-19th, August 25th-26th or Sept 8th-9th.

If this is something you offer, I'd appreciate any information or maybe scheduling some time to speak.

Thanks!

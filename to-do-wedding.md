# Let's get married

I'm planning my wedding for this summer and I'm curious to know if you were willing to offer the rental of a portion of the camp facilities for the event. Ideally the date we'd be looking for would be August 18th, August 25th or Sept 8th.

We wouldn't need much; ideally lake access, some area to prepare and store food and maybe a handful of cabins for out of town family to spend the night. As we are working on a tight budget, we're open to whatever options you'd have to offer.

If this is something you offer or would consider, I'd appreciate any information and maybe scheduling some time to speak.

If so, any information you coulod provide with regard to dates available, pricing, photos of the space, facilities available etc would be greatl;y appreciated.

Et si vous préférez m'écrire en français, n'hésitez pas.

Thanks for your time!

# Canoe trip packing list

When packing, keep in mind that all of your personal items must be compact. If you need help, your guide will help you pack all your gear in your dry bag.


Do not bring the following:
■	Extra food of any kind – odorous items invite insects and critters into cabins/tents and may cause life-­‐threatening harm to those with food allergies.
■	When packing, please keep any highly odorous items away from your clothing
■	NO video games, cell phones, computers, iPods etc.

- We can rent waterproof barrels for storing your gear or we can use a combination of dry bags and backpacks if you already have some. We should discuss this in advance.
- Try not to bring too much clothing. Canoes have limited space so we have to stay within these constraints. You don't need a fresh outfit every day, just day clothes and comfortable night clothes. See the packing list for examples.
canoe gloves
Sun hat or baseball cap
Wool or fleece cap
Canoe gloves
Booties
Waterproof/Breathable Layers

## Personal

We can rent waterproof barrels for storing our gear or we can use a combination of dry bags and backpacks if you already have some. We should discuss this in advance.

When packing, keep in mind that all of your personal items must be compact. If you need help, your guide will help you choose what to bring and pack all your gear in your dry bag.

Contact lenses are difficult to clean on a trip, if you need them, it is suggested that you bring glasses instead. An eyeglass safety strap for your glasses can save your trip.

zpacks food bag
bear container



Silky Saws, Avoid: Sven saws, bow saws
Bahco 24" replacement saw blade (Dry Wood)
Paprika, Salt, Pepper, Other Spices
Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil
Kleen Kanteen 64oz water bottle
Imusa Aluminum Mug 1.25qt - Big enough to cook in, and it nests with the 64oz water bottle. Plus they're cheap. You don't need fancy titanium gear that will warp over an open flame. Aluminum will do nicely.
Avoid: Overpriced titanium cookware, cheap heavy steel cookware
Ziplock Freezer Bags
Esee Striker for Flint and Steel
100% Cotton Shemagh - Tie the corners together to make a bag or a sling, wet it and wrap it around your neck to keep you cool on a hot day, use it to take hot pots off the fire, create shade, or even just use it for a little extra warmth at night.
Avoid: Synthetic fiber scarves and blends (they melt and catch fire easily)
Altoids - The tins are great for making char cloth for flint and steel, storing your fishing hooks or other small items. Plus the mints themselves will help cover up the taste of water purification tabs and they can be used to attract fish.
#36 Tarred Bankline - Avoid: Paracord, 550 Cord (Except Titan)
A Trowel (not a folding shovel - wtf this isnt WW2) - Light weight and cheap, good for digging holes and Dakota firepits. Don't leave home without it. Military style e-tools are way too heavy and have a tendency to lock shut if moisture is present. If you are hitting hard soil use a sharpened tree limb instead. - Avoid: Folding shovels (You aren't digging a trench, this isn't the Somme)
Mora Classic - Folding Utility Survival Knife
MSR Aquatabs (store with a big ziplock - can be used for water holder)

Mosquitoes are worst during the month of June. It’s difficult to eliminate this nuisance, but it can be minimized. Here are some recommendations:

 

•  DON'T MOVE ABOUT TOO MUCH:
When you move a lot or act nervously, your body releases more carbonic gas and you perspire more, which stimulates biting insects.

 

• ON LAND, REMAIN COMPLETELY CLOTHED:
Wear loose clothes, preferably light coloured, avoid jeans; tuck pants into socks; cover the head; protect your neck. People who are particularly sensitive to insect bites might consider wearing canvas gloves and a cap with a mosquito net attached.

 

• IF NEEDED, APPLY REPELLENT ON EXPOSED PARTS OF THE BODY:
The most effective on the market is diethyl-toluamide (DEET). This works by blocking the receptors that enable insects to detect the chemical presence of its prey. However, you need to carefully follow the manufacturer’s directions since this product can irritate some people’s skin and damage certain synthetic materials, including plastic (glasses frames, watch straps, penknife sheaths, etc.). A product containing 30% DEET is sufficient.

 

Some natural oils (citronella, soya) are more appropriate for young children and individuals who are sensitive to DEET. The secret is to apply small amounts of repellent but frequently. Some net clothing can be impregnated with DEET. This type of protection is, in our view, very effective and less injurious for your skin than direct application.

 

• WHEN PORTAGING, AVOID STOPPING TO REST:
Keep moving, making several trips to portage all your equipment in stages. Once on the water, paddle away from the shore quickly to escape the mosquitoes, then rest.

 

• CHOOSE A DRY, AIRY SPOT TO PITCH YOUR TENT:
Close the insect screen of your tent before erecting it. Don’t light any lamps inside the tent before you’ve tightly closed the screen.

 

• SOOTH IRRITATION CAUSED BY INSECT BITES:
The most effective remedies are calamine lotion and a paste of bicarbonate soda
and water.

 

• AVOID USING SCENTED SHAMPOO AND SOAP, AS WELL AS PERFUME AND AFTER-SHAVE LOTIONS.

Silky Saws
Avoid: Sven saws, bow saws

Bahco 24" replacement saw blade (Dry Wood)
Ten bucks and maybe an ounce of pack weight you can have all you need to build a full sized buck saw. Either pack it flat in your bedroll or curl it up into a circle and throw it in the bottom of a bag. Survival Sherpa has a great how to on how to build a bucksaw from some scrap lumber, but it also works with sticks gathered from the woods. https://survivalsherpa.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/how-to-build-a-sturdy-takedown-bucksaw/

Paprika, Salt, Pepper, Other Spices

Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil

Kleen Kanteen 64oz water bottle





Imusa Aluminum Mug 1.25qt
Big enough to cook in, and it nests with the 64oz water bottle. Plus they're cheap. You don't need fancy titanium gear that will warp over an open flame. Aluminum will do nicely. 

Avoid: Overpriced titanium cookware, cheap heavy steel cookware



Ziplock Freezer Bags

Esee Striker for Flint and Steel






100% Cotton Shemagh
Tie the corners together to make a bag or a sling, wet it and wrap it around your neck to keep you cool on a hot day, use it to take hot pots off the fire, create shade, or even just use it for a little extra warmth at night.

Avoid: Synthetic fiber scarves and blends (they melt and catch fire easily)



Altoids
The tins are great for making char cloth for flint and steel, storing your fishing hooks or other small items. Plus the mints themselves will help cover up the taste of water purification tabs and they can be used to attract fish.


#36 Tarred Bankline
Avoid: Paracord, 550 Cord (Except Titan)



A Trowel (not a folding shovel - wtf this isnt WW2)
Light weight and cheap, good for digging holes and Dakota firepits. Don't leave home without it. Military style e-tools are way too heavy and have a tendency to lock shut if moisture is present. If you are hitting hard soil use a sharpened tree limb instead. 

Avoid: Folding shovels (You aren't digging a trench, this isn't the Somme)


Mora Classic

Folding Utility Survival Knife


MSR Aquatabs (store with a big ziplock - can be used for water holder)





Suunto A30-L
Gorrila Tape
emergency ponchos
Fresnel Lenses
bic lighters


Original Mechanix Gloves

100% wool cap




Clothing and Equipment List For Your Canoe Trip:
This is only a guide to what you need for your trip. The important thing to remember is to try and stay away from cotton clothing as much as possible, or at least bring some along only for the hot days of your trip. Some of these items are optional so it is not necessary to have everything on this list. We supply waterproof barrels for storing your gear so do not worry about bringing a back pack. We will give you the barrels at the start of your trip. Try not to bring too much clothing. Canoes have limited space so we have to stay within these constraints. There is usually plenty of time to dry clothing if things get wet. If you do not have some of the required items please call us and we will try and locate suitable items. If possible bring your own sleeping bag and mat, however, these can be borrowed if you do not have your own.


Fabrics
The clothing layers should consist of several different types of fabrics. Cotton is comfortable and breathable, but it absorbs and retains water, and therefore it will not keep you warm if it gets wet. Also it can be difficult to dry. For this reason you should not bring heavy cotton clothes such as sweatshirts, sweatpants or blue jeans. Cotton T-shirts and underwear are fine as are lightweight cotton shirts and pants. Polypropylene or other hydrophobic synthetic fabrics move the moisture (sweat) away from your body to the outside of the layer, reducing evaporative cooling and keeping you dry and comfortable. Wool or synthetic pile/fleece fabrics don't absorb water so they keep you warm even if they get wet. Pile also dries very quickly. A wool sweater or pile jacket provides warmth on a chilly evening. Nylon or Nylon/Cotton Windshells reduce convective heat loss. For raingear, coated nylon is lightweight and works well. Waterproof-breathable fabrics are also possible but are expensive.


The Layering System
Combinations of these types of fabrics creates a layering system. The purpose of a layering system is to be able to mix and match the layers of insulation to match the weather conditions and your activity level to maintain a comfortable body temperature without excess sweating (which can lead to heat loss). Throughout the day you will need to layer up and layer down as conditions and activity levels change. Typically in the morning and evening when it is colder, you will need many layers on. The inner layer keeps the skin dry and comfortable. The middle layer provides some insulation and protection from the elements. Long-sleeve shirts and long pants make up this layer. You may wear these during the day for or in the evening when your activity level is low and it starts to cool off. The outer layer provides insulation. You will wear this around camp at night. The shell layer protects you from wind and rain. A waterproof rain jacket is essential in case of bad weather. The head layers are for sun and rain protection during the day and to reduce heat loss when it cools down. The feet layer is actually two layers. You should wear a lightweight synthetic liner sock against your foot which helps pass moisture away from your foot. On top of this you wear a wool/nylon blend hiking sock. People wonder why you should wear a wool sock with summer heat. Since wool doesn't absorb water it passes the moisture from your foot outwards, keeping your foot dryer. If your feet stay damp, they get wrinkled and are more prone to blisters. Having two sock layers means that your socks will slide against each other so that the friction from your boots is between the sock layers rather than against your skin (friction against the skin leads to blisters).


CLOTHING LIST
Head:
_______ Wool/Pile Hat (must cover ears)
_______ Brimmed hat (for sun protection)


Upper Body:
_______ Lightweight Synthetic Long Undershirt - polypropylene, or other hydrophobic, wicking
fabric
_______ Midweight Polypropylene Top/Wool Shirt - long sleeve
_______ Midweight Pile Jacket /Wool Sweater - (ex. Polartec 200) two of these are nice to have
in case one gets wet during the day.
_______ Wind Jacket - nylon (can be same as rain jacket if waterproof/breathable - must fit over
insulating layers)


Hands:
_______ Synthetic/Wool Glove liners


Lower Body:
_______ Underwear as needed. 2 pairs are usually sufficient for your trip.
_______ Midweight Synthetic/Wool long underwear bottoms - polypropylene, or other
hydrophobic, wicking fabric

_______ 1 pair of midweight hiking boots (boots are optional, a dry pair of sneakers for wearing
around camp will also be sufficient, boots are handy if it is raining.
_______ 1 pair of running shoes, sneakers, or sandals: For around campsite wear and/or canoeing
during the day.
_______ 2 pairs of medium weight wool hiking socks: Wool keeps your feet warm even when
wet and gives good cushioning. The higher the wool content of the socks the better (we
recommend 85% wool, 15% nylon).

Compression sacks
Note: You really can't beat the Sea to Summit bags.  They're 1/4 of the weight and bulk of the competition, sturdier, almost equal in price, and, they're fucking waterproof!
Note: Compression sacks are usually packed in another tougher, waterproof bag or pack.  1 large or 2 med should be more than enough for packing down your sleeping bag and clothes.

  * $30 Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Compression Dry Sack -nothing stacks up these and are pretty affordable
  * 5¢ Pair of Garbage bags -If you pack right, these work great; but they're a bitch to unpack and repack every night and tear super easy


Camp Knife
In the outdoors, a good knife is essential.  Anything sharp will do, but a half serrated blade is ideal for backpacking & camping.

I've only listed essential camp knives and multi-tools here; so, if you're looking to get into whitewater safety or are preparing for the apocalypse, feel free to pick my brain for other options.  Additionally, all the knives I've listed, while great for backpacking, will also serve you round the house year-round.

  * $25 Gerber/Bear Grylls Scout Knife -my top pick for your first camp knife
  * $40 Victorinox Farmer or Hiker -my top picks for your first camp multi-tool (the saw is really useful)
  * $180 Leatherman Charge TTI -you'll never need another tool; however, it's heavy and expensive
  * $60-70 Leatherman Juice S2 or Skeletool -less expensive multi-tools
  * $40 Leatherman Squirt PS4 -knife is really small but it makes a good spare or accessory tool if you have another knife

Spare / PDF knife:
Optional but very useful, an easy-access, water-resistant knife that you can clip to your PDF is an asset for quick access on the water, dealing with lines and general safety.  Also, it keeps your primary knife or multi-tool away from the water, allowing you to pack it away when in canoe transit.

    * $30 Gerber River Shorty -Trip leaders top pick for over 10 years
    * $40 NRS Pilot & Co-Pilot -Nice clip features



Headlamp
There's a dizzying array of lamps out there and most manufacturers lie about their stats (no joke, it's actually a pretty big issue.)  Fortunately, the guys at Outdoor Gear Lab did 9 months of testing with over 80 top models.

  * $64 Black Diamond ReVolt -not the best in any one cat but overall has a good balance of brightnes/battery life (my choice)
  * $54 Black Diamond Storm -similar lighting to the ReVolt but no USB charging and slightly worse battery life; however, IT'S WATERPROOF!
  * $50 Coast HL7 -second runner up for all purpose light, ok battery life
  * $15 Petzl Tikkina -best buy, a good close proximity light (in the tent & around the campsite) not so great at trail finding
  * $22 Petzl e+LITE -even less bright but really, really, really small, about the size of a chapstick (my spare)
  * $86 Black Diamond Icon -bright but heavy and bulky
  * $60 Fenix HP25 -huge and chugs batteries but will replicate the sun


Water Bottle
Though we'll have camp water bags, it's essential to have a personal water bottle to carry with you

  * $20 Klean Kanteen Original 27
  * $7-10 Any Nalgene Wide Mouth
  * $0 Plastic pop or Gatorade Bottle

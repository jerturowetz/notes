## Notes

- Drive from main gate was an extra-long 45+ minutes into the parc
- Sites were a little off the water, comfortable and relatively isolated
- Each site supported 2 tents (we were 4)
- It's possible to go through 3-4 bundles of wood a night
- Wood can be sourced with a car and a saw
- Raras canopy was dope for the camp kitchen
- Campsite was good, rowboats available on shoreline
- Swimming was ok. Fine if you go out with a boat but crap for wading in (mucky, reedy).
- Camping is open 22may to 7 sept

Spoke to check in people and they recommended some sites, made notes on the map (where is it?)

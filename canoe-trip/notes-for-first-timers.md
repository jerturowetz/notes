# Notes for first timers

- If you're missing items, do your best to borrow from friends. There is no need to go out and buy a lot of gear for a short trip. This is especially true for clothing.
- Don't keep food in your personal bag, pockets and definitely don't bring food in to your tent.
- Paddlers' hands take a lot of abuse from wind, weather and waves. Keep them as dry as possible. Wearing gloves protects hands from the elements and can prevent blisters, especially in newer paddlers who may tend to have a tighter grip on their paddle.
- Sitting in a canoe and paddling all day can be uncomfortable for first timers. You will be expected to tough it out.

## Clothing: intro to fabrics

While cotton is comfortable and breathable, it absorbs and retains water and will not keep you warm if it gets wet. It is also difficult to dry. For this reason you should not bring heavy cotton clothes such as sweatshirts, sweatpants or blue jeans. Cotton t-shirts, underwear and lightweight pants are fine, but merino, polypropylene or other hydrophobic synthetic fabrics are better. These fabrics move moisture away from your body to the outside of the layer, reducing evaporative cooling and keeping you dry and comfortable. Merino or synthetic underwear and t-shirts (think Lululemon) are comfortable to wear all day even if a bit sweaty or wet from the water.

Wool or synthetic pile/fleece fabrics don't absorb water so they keep you warm even if they get wet. I prefer fleece as it is lightweight and dries quickly. Wool and fleece generally has no wind blocking and should be paired with an outer shell in breezy conditions. While down jackets are lightweight, easy to pack, and provide excellent insulation, they are expensive and must be kept dry. I prefer fleece or wool when canoe camping and would only use a down jacket on dry evenings around camp. I'd go so far as to keep inaccessible during the day, stuffed in my sleeping bag to keep it dry.

For shells, Nylon or Nylon/Cotton Windshells reduce convective heat loss. For raingear, coated nylon is lightweight and works well. Waterproof-breathable fabrics are also possible but are expensive. I usually just bring a rain shell that can double as a wind layer if absoluetly necessary. This layer should be easy to access during the day (like a top pocket of a personal bag).

Pack a bathing suit but don't plan on wearing it during the canoing. It will get really uncomfortable really fast.

In general, your clothes should be breathable but robust. We're looking for protection from bugs, wind, rain & rocks and the ability to tear down layers quick to stay cool on hot days. Oh, and stay away from blue, for some reason mosquitos like blue.

### Clothing: layering

Throughout the day you will need to layer up and layer down as conditions and activity levels change in order to stay comfortable.

An inner layer should keep your skin dry and comfortable. A long sleeved shirt or t-shirt, underpants and liner socks comprise this layer. Typically you wont change this layer all day so it should be balanced to manage both the coldest and warmest part of the day.

Your middle layer provides some insulation and protection from the elements. A hat for sun protection, a long-sleeve shirt and long pants make up this layer. Think protection from bugs, rocks and brush. This layer should be easy to take on/off and easy to store. You'll probably change in and out of this layer infrequently as you can always roll up your sleeves and pant legs (or have zip offs) if it gets hot instead of changing.

Outer layers provide insulation or additional protection from the elements. A fleece sweater and cap can keep you warm around camp at night. A shell layer can protect you on a windy day. A waterproof rain jacket is essential in case of bad weather.

For you feet I recommend combining a lightweight synthetic liner sock and a wool/nylon blend hiking sock on top. Since wool doesn't absorb water it passes the moisture from your foot outwards, keeping your foot dryer. If your feet stay damp, they get wrinkled and are more prone to blisters. Having two sock layers means that your socks will slide against each other so that the friction from your boots is between the sock layers rather than against your skin (friction against the skin leads to blisters).

## Mosquitoes

Mosquitoes are worst in June and pretty bad in general. It’s difficult to eliminate this nuisance, but it can be minimized. Here are some recommendations:

- **Don't move about too much:**
  When you move a lot or act nervously, your body releases more carbonic gas and you perspire more, which stimulates biting insects.
- **On land, remain completely clothed:**
  Wear loose clothes, preferably light coloured (not blue); tuck pants into socks; cover the head; protect your neck. People who are particularly sensitive to insect bites might consider wearing canvas gloves and a cap with a mosquito net attached.
- **Apply insect repellent to both exposed parts of body and clothing frequently:**
  I prefer to use insect repellent with DEET, but DEET is a strong chemical and can irritate some people’s skin and damage certain synthetic materials so some people prefer natural oils (citronella, soya).
- **When portaging, avoid stopping to rest:**
  Keep moving, making several trips to portage all your equipment in stages. Once on the water, paddle away from the shore quickly to escape the mosquitoes, then rest.
- **Choose a dry, airy spot to pitch your tent:**
  Close the insect screen of your tent before erecting it. Don’t light any lamps inside the tent before you’ve tightly closed the screen.
- **Sooth irritation caused by insect bites:**
  The most effective remedies are calamine lotion and a paste of bicarbonate soda and water. I like afterbite.
- **Avoid using scented shampoo and soap,**
  Don't bring any, we have soap.

# Notes for first timers

## Mosquitoes

Mosquitoes are worst in June, and pretty bad in general. It’s difficult to eliminate this nuisance, but it can be minimized. Here are some recommendations:

- **Don't move about too much:**
  When you move a lot or act nervously, your body releases more carbonic gas and you perspire more, which stimulates biting insects.
- **On land, remain completely clothed:**
  Wear loose clothes, preferably light coloured, avoid jeans; tuck pants into socks; cover the head; protect your neck. People who are particularly sensitive to insect bites might consider wearing canvas gloves and a cap with a mosquito net attached.
- **Apply insect repellent to both exposed parts of body and clothing frequently:**
  I prefer to use insexc repellent with DEET, but DEET is a strong chemical and can irritate some people’s skin and damage certain synthetic materials so some people prefer natural oils (citronella, soya).
- **When portaging, avoid stopping to rest:**
  Keep moving, making several trips to portage all your equipment in stages. Once on the water, paddle away from the shore quickly to escape the mosquitoes, then rest.
- **Choose a dry, airy spot to pitch your tent:**
  Close the insect screen of your tent before erecting it. Don’t light any lamps inside the tent before you’ve tightly closed the screen.
- **Sooth irritation caused by insect bites:**
  The most effective remedies are calamine lotion and a paste of bicarbonate soda and water. I like afterbite.
- **Avoid using scented shampoo and soap,**
  Don't bring any with.

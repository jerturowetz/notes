# Jeremy Turowetz QUealifications Re Website Work - web@aa87.org

Hi Raoul,

Nice speaking with you yesterday. I put together a list of my previous experience, both in AA and as a developer and have provided references below where appropriate.

## AA qualifications

My sobriety date is August 11 2011. In addition to having been a member of several groups over the last 6 years including North End English, Monday Central, Vendome Beginners & Hip Slick Young & Sick, here are some positions of note that I've occupied:

**Treasurer**
Young People Saturday Night Sober
_October 2011 - December 2013_

**RDP youth facility meeting organizer & MONQYPAA liaison**
Hospitals & Institutions Area 87 English
_December 2012 - December 2014_

**Panel organizer for MONQYPAA & Young People's AA**
EMAC conference (AA & Al-Anon)
_January 2015 - April 2015_

## Developer qualifications

I work full time at [BKDSN](http://bkdsn.com) as a web developer. I've managed projects for several serious clients including Brother, Reebok, Telus and VSM. Below you'll find links to some of my more recent projects:

- [ADS Data](https://www.adsdata.ca/)
- [Apotheon strategies](http://apotheon.ca/)
- [VSF Services](https://www.vsfservices.ca/)
- [Sucre and Sweet](https://sucreandsweet.com/)

If you like, you can also look at my [personal website](https://jerturowetz.github.io/) and my [Professional CV](https://jerturowetz.github.io/cv.html)

## General availability

As we discussed, if it would help you out, I'd be happy to consider a position on your committee though it would depend on the service commitment and required availability. Whether I'd join the committee or not, I'd still like to make myself available to you & your team to get to work fixing errors and improving the overall website experience.

## Next steps

If you're interested in my help, the next steps would be for me to meet with you and the team so that we can discuss priorities as well as set a loose timeline for getting me access to required resources.

I'm available Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday evenings after 6pm and most weekends. ???

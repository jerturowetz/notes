## Ingredients

- 4 cups shredded cabbage
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 small carrot, grated
- 2 to 3 medium scallions, thinly sliced
- 1/2 to 1 whole jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced (optional)
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Sugar, honey, or agave nectar (optional)*
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Preparations

Place the cabbage in a colander or strainer and sprinkle with the salt. Massage and squeeze the cabbage with your hands to help it release its liquid and begin wilting. Place in the sink or over another bowl, and set aside to drain for about 15 minutes.

Using your hands, squeeze the cabbage of its excess liquid one handful at a time, and transfer to a large bowl. Add the carrot, scallions, and jalapeño if using. Toss to combine. Add the mayonnaise, lime juice, and garlic and toss to combine. Taste and season with a sweetener, salt, or pepper as needed.

# Recipie: Spatchcock, Herb-Rubbed Turkey

Turkeys are an operation so good thing you're an operator! PLAN AHEAD: this will very likely take about 90 mins of prep & 90 mins of cooking. The turkey also needs to rest for about 20 mins after you're done so Get started 3 & 1/2 hours before you want to eat.

If you plan your sides right, you can prepare them while the turkey is cooking.

## Spatchcocking the bird

You'll need a good pair of poultry shears for this. There are a few guides, they're all mostly the same. Ignore the recipies, this is just the spatchcocking part.

## Cooking the bird

### Ingredients

- 1 turkey (12 to 14 pounds?)
- 3 large yellow onions, 2 roughly chopped, the other peeled & halved
- 4 stalks celery, roughly chopped
- 3 large carrots, roughly chopped
- 12 sprigs thyme
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 4 medium cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup roughly chopped chives
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves
- 1/4 cup fresh sage leaves
- 1 medium shallot, thinly sliced
- 2 sticks butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 1/2 quarts low-sodium chicken or turkey broth
- 4 tbsp flour

### Directions

#### Turkey pt 1

Pat turkey dry with paper towels.

Roughly chop some onions, carrots, and celery, set aside for a sec.

Adjust oven rack to middle-lower (as we want the bird in the middle - not the rack) position and preheat oven to 425°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil, add 2/3rds of the chopped veg and some thyme stems. Place slotted broiler rack or wire rack on top.

Combine garlic, chives, parsley, sage, thyme, and shallots in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse, scraping down sides as necessary, until finely chopped and no large pieces remain. Scatter butter chunks on top. Pulse until homogenous paste is formed. Season generously with salt and pepper and pulse to combine (NO SALT IF YOU DID A SALT BRINE). Transfer half of butter mixture to a small saucepan and melt over low heat.

I think I'm also gonna add a few sprigs of sage and 1/2 an onion to the inside

Gently separate the skin of the turkey from the flesh using your hands, going in through the bottom of the breast and working up along both breast halves and the thighs. Using your hands, rub butter directly on the turkey meat underneath the skin all over. Massage the skin from the outside until the butter is distributed in an even layer. [Instructions here for getting the butter in under the skin](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-food-lab-how-to-make-herb-butter-roasted-turkey-thanksgiving-recipe.html)

Brush exterior of the turkey with the melted butter until evenly coated. Season the turkey with salt (NO SALT IF YOU DID A SALT BRINE) and pepper and transfer to the wire rack.

Place the turkey & tuck the wings under etc according to the spacchcocking directions.

Transfer turkey to oven and roast for about 80 minutes, rotating occasionally. We want an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast to register 150°F, and the thighs register at least 165°F.

#### Gravy pt 1

While turkey roasts, make the gravy.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 3 quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Roughly chop the neck, backbone, and giblets. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, another 5 minutes.

Add chicken stock, remaining thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Allow to cook 45 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh strainer into a 2 quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from the surface of the broth.

#### Gravy pt 2

Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2 quart saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until flour is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add broth in a thin, steady stream until it it all incorporated. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to about 1 quart, about 20 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep gravy warm.

#### Turkey pt 2 : carving & gravy pt3

Remove from oven and allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Serve immediately.

When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from out of the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and dicard. Whisk juices into gravy.

Hi Darcy & Mike,

I wanted to let you know that I'm having a hard time getting this site deployyed.

I'm primarily a designer, not a web developer, so, when it comes to deploynehts, I stick to a pretty regular, and reliable, routine.

My routine is pretty standard in the wordpress realm: I upload theme code, plugins and visual assets to a server and then migrate over the database from my dev environment to the production database server. 

I follow up by bug fixing any issues with URL inconsistency or File references by tweaking config settings or by running scripts on the server. This is normally not necessary with managed hosts, but nearly always necessary with budget ones as theyre all configured a bit differently.

darcy, Installing the theme via the word press admin, Would not cover the siyes data, plugins or uploaded media, which i would hacevto ibstall and configure one by one, all the ehile not having access to the server tontroubleshoot things.

my routibe is standard practice (i nornally dont have to argue for it, but i guess now ill need to add some lines to my contracts). 





That said, I can either deploy the website in my regular way, which is pretty standard practice, or, if there are security issues that you were concerned with, I will deliver you the zip files of the site and you can deploy it and manage any issues on your end.

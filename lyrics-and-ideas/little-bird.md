# Little bird

Hey little bird you sing
Lull me to sleep
Your sound your softness comforting
patter of your feet
sounds of something fine,
fragile and incomplete
now You recognize my face
seems a familiar thing
the more you come to visit me 
Judging by your grace
We see this world in the same way
In magic we both make believe 

--- 

hey little bird (im glad?)
keep coming back to me
but your wings are looking worn and rough 
?? 
still you carry round that cage
too heavy for your little wings
have you had enough? 
now you're flapping in a rage
crashing into heavy things
I'm scared, im breaking up 

Not done, just tune: 
A sound a sign so much
Still seems it'd not enough
Something calls your little bluff 
I got a mind to much and creeping into stuff
Pushing your opinion of

# Secret

I have a secret to keep
I want you to show it

I have a secret to keep
but I want you to know it
the stings only hard for the weak
you tempted to hold it?
The eb you've caught us in
spun from out of your mind
the rat you're looking for
is just one of your kind

You had a secret to keep
But it twisted and bloated
Now the phone hasn't rung in a week
Do you know that I know it?
Escape is all temporary, arbitrary highs
It wouldn't take much to carry, help might make it light

## Chorus in 2

Why i can't find my place
Find the way
To something more than temporary, temporary
Stay
We'll find a way
To make things all right, all right?

I'm not going to my grave
Without giving it a try

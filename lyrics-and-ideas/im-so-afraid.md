# I'm so afraid

Don't know what it is
But I feel better when I'm moving
Might be compulsive or cracked,
Can you help me out?

Salt stained teeth
Salt stained leash

## PRE CHORUS

I'm so afraid
Didn't think feet could tread this lightly
At this pace
My teeth will die before my mouth

But I might
Survive
For you

The right disguise can save
From stone knives
Nervous minds

My teeth will die before my mouth

But I might
Survive
For you

The right disguise can save
From stone knives
Nervous minds

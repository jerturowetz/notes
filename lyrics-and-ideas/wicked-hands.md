# Wicked hands

Hey man are you sneaking in
To my lands? You're better off leaving
I'll hold whatever I feel's mine

My claim to this shattered earth
Passed on by weaker men
Was hard won and paid with hard time

Hey man stowe your thieving grin
You'd best keep traveling
A soft toung will bleed drinking my wine

Take note of these weathered hands
Worn raw through suffrage
A callused heart can wait a long time

Fill your need
Feed your greed
And you'll see
How men will bleed

hey man
see you travelling
through my land
you're better of leaving
cause ill hold whatever ive claimed mine

ive scraped at this broken earth
passed on by weaker men
ive toiled and bled
ive paid my time

hey man sink your shallow grin

Hey man don't you settle in

You've lived by little worth
Smooth smile and thieving hands
Well my skin's been cracked
By blood and toi
I've worked these fields

My bones raised battlements
While yours been taking bread

The roads of this broken earth

I'll make this ground run red
You'll see what to suffer is

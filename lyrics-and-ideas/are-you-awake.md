# Are you awake

are you awake
are you not fine
did you survive the day
come out alive?
i cant see to say
the things that i thinking
an ocean of grey
keeps my mouth from my mind
this corpse that I'm building
divide
think we'll survive
is this fulfilling
should be

can they not see
the this worlds killing
come out ahead
doubt we'll come out alive

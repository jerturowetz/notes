# Concrete boots

we went to the water
to sell sons and daughters
she smiled when i saw her
and I was her slave

her fortune compelling
and my ego swelling
I took what I wanted
and then I was damned

I promised her nothing
and she looked away
a dog for the culling
might seem led astray
but malice is purposed
when attracted to sin
Too to see
through her wicked grin

but heavy price bought
'cause she was the daughter
and i was the lamb

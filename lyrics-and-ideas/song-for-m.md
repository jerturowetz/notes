# Song for M

She wakes
Bright by the dawn
Forgetful of sleep
Nerves tight, head high
new day begun

Might last
For only a moment
But it's enough
to get outside
to help push her on

she longs
she wants to be
restored from the echoes of the past
and wild like the sea

please god
push them away
bring me to port alive
and free from the waves
////
she wakes
breaks by the dawn
her heart skips a bit, gathers her wits
new days begun
the calm lasts
for only a moment
because the tow of the past seeps in with
the salt in the air and its gone
/
she longs, she longs to be
restored and her wounds repaired,
wild like the sea
he sails, he sails away
yearns for the safety of shore
to survive the day
....to see her again



////
she wakes
up with the dawn
this moment to feel alive inside
and it's on

it fades
sinks in her heart
courage curtails with that first step
man is this hard


it lasts
only a moment


///
she knows, she knows her way
alone, you're just barely alive
hiding from pain
he flows, just like the waves
appears and he's gone in a day
weeks / months the same

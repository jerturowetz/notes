# Mosquito

leech
fly bite getting mad when i swat at you feasting
m.c. ism of a person lacks in outward sight
realizing nothing more than the self
fucking prick
like a stain teaches one to be more careful
when choosing friends
all my fault anyways, faith is for things without form - ain't that depressing
magnanimity draws from my dependanceÂ is fleeting - is going to leave my weak ass mind angry and raving
i haven't grown yet
i just like to hate you
with all your toys and charm
i have the funny feeling, though i always feel alone, you'll end up that way

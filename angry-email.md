Hi guys,

EQ doesnt work any more....
I spent 150$ on a repair that didnt do anything , broke more faders and I'm pretty sure the parts you ordered were incorrect

Suffice it to say I'm a bit angry

Is there anything you can do about this?

I understand tech fees arent based on success, but I dont think it's fair that I paid you and you rendered my equipment non functional...

I'd like a refund on the money I spent

You can keep the eq if you want

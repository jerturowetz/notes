## LIFT IN-SCHOOL PROGRAM

After years of experience working with teenagers, our Co-Director Jonathan Sbrollini gathered a team of health experts gathered around the belief that good health is the best medicine and can prevent many harmful situation from ever occurring. After witnessing a incredible positive growth and healing with the youth at Camp LIFT, the LIFT team created in-school programs that encompasses the whole experience of Camp LIFT condensed into 8 weeks. The program is currently being executed in 3 high-schools and many more to come.

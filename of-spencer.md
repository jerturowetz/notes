Some random thoughts kate saved about a dead gay dog who was the best

## "Whatever. You’re too into stuff."

Spencer came into the living room and made an announcement.

> I’m selling all your stuff.

Wait, what?

> Yeah, I’m selling all your stuff. Your couch is already on Craigslist.

He showed me the ad.

“You know what I always say,” he said, answering a question no one asked. “Sex smells.”

Moving on.

I asked if he didn’t think he ought to check with the proprietors of the stuff. He said he didn’t see what the big deal was.

> You never even use that couch.

I pointed out that we were both sitting on it at that very moment, and we had guests who would be using its pull-out function all weekend long.

> Whatever. You’re too into stuff.

Something smelled fishy, and it wasn’t the fish carcass he’d dragged with him into the room. Craigslist? Spencer actually calls email ‘he-male’ and thinks it’s some kind of telegram/male prostitution service. 

Things Spencer has said to me about email/he-male:

I’ll send you a he-male about it; he will tell you and give you everything you need.

I don’t know why people complain about junk on their he-male. I love the junk on my he-male.

That’s not a he-male, that’s a he-blast.

I would like to have sex with my he-male.

Obviously, I try to avoid discussing email with Spencer.

Given he’s not exactly internet savvy, I asked him how he managed Craigslist.

> I paid the Bee to do it. Well, I say ‘paid’. I told him he could take me out for a beer. I say ‘beer’. A cosmopolitan. I said he could take me out for a cosmopolitan. On a Monday.

The thing is, Spencer can’t stand the Bee — he says he’s asinine — and usually refuses to be seen in public with him. (Unless he needs a lift somewhere.) So this whole thing was way off. I pushed, and not subtly.

> Alright fine. I need some cash. My publisher called. There’s a technicality with my royalties, or something. It’s not a big deal so you should probably stop freaking out.

I looked at him blankly.

> What? We’re having a garage sale. It’ll be fun! You can do all the work.

He then vomited on the floor, and promptly left the room.

## "He’s in love with me. Lust. Longing? It’s hard to tell the difference."

> I’ve fired my therapist.

Spencer made this announcement after showing up 75 minutes late for our lunch date at St-Hubert’s. (His choice. He likes those giant $4 daiquiris.) I’d long since learned that querying his lack of punctuality led nowhere good, or interesting, so I queried him instead on the dramatic decision. They’d been together twelve years.

> He’s in love with me. Or lust. Longing? It’s hard to tell them apart until the gifts start.

I sighed, hoping to hide a yawn, and signalled to the waiter. I asked Spencer how he knew this time. (This was a well worn path with him. Everyone seemed to fall in love with Spencer, eventually. Even if they didn’t know it. Even if it wasn’t true.)

> He wrote me a letter. Or a declaration. A manifesto? It’s pathetic.

The waiter came over. Spencer proceeded to lick his hand and forearm, making it up past the crook of the elbow before the appendage was withdrawn. Politesse oblige, or something.

> I will have 7 daiquiris poured into a large, shallow bowl, and my friend here is old-fashioned.

I clarified my drink order with the young man before he scurried back to the kitchen, then I asked Spencer if I could see the letter.

> Why would you want...Oh.

He scrunched his stupid little face up like he finally understood something, and that something was pitiful.

> Of course you can. How thoughtless of me - you’ve never seen one have you? A love letter, I mean. No, of course you haven’t. Here. Here, it’s all yours.

He hastily added:

> Except you have to give it back to me because it’s not really yours, it’s mine and it was written about me and to me.

	Spencer,
	
	I fear the situation is unworkable. You are such a unique and unparalleled case that I am at a loss as to how to proceed.
	
	As you are aware, you are an incredibly attractive individual. In fact, that’s an understatement. As your family regularly acknowledges, there is a fair chance that you would no longer be in your present, rather comfortable, living situation were it not for the fact that you are so incredibly attractive. But - let’s leave aside the significant psychological damage such pressure might have done.
	
	So, you owe the fact that you are alive - in some ways, your livelihood - to your looks. This, in and of itself, is not so uncommon. Actors, models, meteorologists - there are a number of individuals who benefit (socially, sexually, financially, etc.) from their appearance. Your appearance alone is not what makes you special, special as it is.
	
	What’s remarkable about you is that your looks aren’t fading. And given that you’re 119 years old and people still think you’re a teenager, it “looks” (ha ha) like they’re here to stay. 
	
	Spencer, this eternal spring could not be more detrimental to your development. Most people who look like you do eventually don’t, and they suffer a rather rude awakening. It’s hard, yes, to realize that your appearance opens fewer doors, incites fewer invitations, pays for fewer dinners. But - BUT! - as hard as it is, like anything hard that doesn’t come easy (Spencer, stay focused, do NOT make an erection joke), it’s worth it in the end. 
	
	One day, the uncommonly attractive find they must develop personalities, something they may have managed to live their entire lives without. They become kind. Or charitable. They learn a trade. They interest themselves in other facets of whatever industry supported them to this point - actors direct biopics, models take close-up pictures of other models without makeup, meteorologists chair animal protection societies. Regular people learn how to cook. They invest themselves in something external to their own being.
	
	But you - you, my beautiful, bewildered, belligerent soul - you won’t ever have to do that. You won’t have to grow, or learn, or love. (As we’ve discussed in more sessions than I care to count, draping yourself horizontally over a Golden Retriever does not qualify as love. It may, however, qualify as denial.) And you’ve never had to be compassionate, kind, funny, understanding, or basically decent, and you never will. You are a statue. I cannot move the immovable.
	
	All you do is take, and I have no more to give. And so, it is with a heavy(ish) heart and an empty wallet that I must bring an end to our professional relationship. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours. 
	
	Sincerely,
	
	Dr. Mallard

    PS - My office has passed your file along to a collection agency. You should be hearing from them soon. Spencer, if I may offer you a final piece of advice - please don’t sleep with the collection agent. He doesn’t deserve that, and it won’t solve any of your problems.

> Yeah, he may have also mentioned something about how I hadn’t paid for the last 26 months of sessions.

## “I bought you a new couch. Here is your credit card back.”

> Remember how I sold your couch? Yeah, so I bought you a new couch. Here is your credit card back.

As he slid my credit card across the table, pushing it along with his aged snout, I tried not to think about where that nose had been. I shuddered to shake off the thought.

> Yeah. You were angry I sold your couch. I bought you a new couch. You are welcome. What is wrong with your face?

I oh-so-briefly thought about explaining the difference between giving a gift and committing credit card fraud, but who has that kind of energy?

> Oh, and I incurred some additional expenses. Being generous caused me to experience fatigue, and also I had left my wallet in my other pants.

I didn’t bother pointing out that he didn’t wear pants.

He deposited a piece of paper on the table and proceeded to make a hacking sound, one that would be worrying if it weren’t so frequent. Or so showy. The ink, wet and fuzzy, had bled into the paper, making the writing hard to decipher, like it had been carried around in an elderly canine’s mouth before being coughed up. Another byproduct of Spencer’s lack of opposable thumbs.

- cheese slices (unwrapped)
- the milk that’s left in the cereal bowl
- chicken carcass (non-splintering)
- 1 lb butter
- slippers (left foot only)
- daiquiri mix
- rum (7)

Spender's weekly shopping. But why was I subsidizing? Since I’d known him – sixteen years – he’d been living (rather largely) off the back of the wildly successful memoir he wrote at age one, SMUTT: Tales of a Misspent Youth. It was, in the words of the book jacket, a “thumping, humping coming-of-dog story”.

> I ran into my agent. No, I literally ran into his car with mine. He said there’s been an issue, a hiccup, really - a hairball - with my royalties. Here is his mechanic’s bill.

With that, Spencer fell off his chair, peed on its leg and left the room.

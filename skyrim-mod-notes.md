# Skyrim :: Mod notes

The XP32 skeleton has options for animations for wild weapon placement (i knida want belt fastened quivers...)
Dual SHeath Redux needs to be messed with if I wanna switch to swords on back (prolly all the animations too)
SMIM can be changed to have 1/2 sized textures
Might need to remove Boat Trapdoors from `Animated Clutter`
If black and purple or rainbow colors on their money bag and alchemy lab tables - set iTexMipMapSkip to the value of 0 in the SkyrimPrefs.ini under [Display]

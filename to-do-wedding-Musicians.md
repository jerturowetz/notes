Padraig 

Hi

I got your email address from Padraig who mentioned you might be available for hire.

I'm looking for a single musician to perform during the two hour slot between the hours of 5 PM and 7 PM next Saturday, September 8.

The event is a cocktail reception Which I'd like to colour with light but festive music. The styles which i think could suit this are klezmer, Acadian, Canadian folk, or Irish Traditional

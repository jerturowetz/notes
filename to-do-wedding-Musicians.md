Wedding musician

Hi Yoni, nice to meet you. My name is Jeremy and I got your email address from Padraig.

I'm looking for a single musician to perform between the hours of 5 and 7 PM next Saturday, September 8 and I was wondering if you would be for hire?

The event is a cocktail reception in Montreal's Mile-End. I'd like to color the event with light but festive music. The styles which I think would suit this are klezmer, Acadian, Canadian folk, Irish traditional, etc.

If you're interested and available, please advise your rates and I'll get right back to you.

Thanks,
Jeremy

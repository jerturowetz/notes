# Divinity: Tips

- There is an oil barrel and an ooze barrel right outside the western gate of Cyseal where you find out the fate of the legion soldiers being sent to the lighthouse
- Water barrels can be found all over Cyseal
- use scrolls and forget about staffs/wands except for Ice wands or Staffs dealing with the "burning legion" near the start of the game
- craft grenades & special arrows early on (frost)
- hold on to +str items
- Pick up every single "cooking pot" you can find in the game (can be used to cover ANY trap vent)
- combine cooking pots with fires for a portable cooking situation

## Crafting

- perception potions (eye + empty vial)
- Slowdown arrows (oil barrel + arrow head)
- Poison arrows (ooze barrel + arrow head)

## Gear storage

Crafting/Blacksmithing items can/should be dumped on a mule

- **Source Hunter:** grenades/parts & arrows/parts
- **Evelyn's:** Quest items
- **Pouch:** +1 gear
- **New red backpack found before first fight of game**: keys

## Mules

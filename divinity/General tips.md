# Divinity: Tips

- Enemies with "immune to fire aura", try to sneak in to the battle and teleport the person with the aura into the middle of your party to start the fight.
- There is an oil barrel and an ooze barrel right outside the western gate of Cyseal where you find out the fate of the legion soldiers being sent to the lighthouse
- Water barrels can be found all over Cyseal
- use scrolls and forget about staffs/wands except for Ice wands or Staffs dealing with the "burning legion" near the start of the game
- craft grenades & special arrows early on (frost)
- hold on to +str items
- Pick up every single "cooking pot" you can find in the game (can be used to cover ANY trap vent)
- combine cooking pots with fires for a portable cooking situation
- You can get +2 to crafting/blacksmithing from belt & brancers. Jahan has a talent that gives +1 also, so he only needs 2/2 to be maxed
- *Burn my eyes* should be cast on your ranger at all times (spot traps & hidden treasure)
- Brenda should pick up all the "touching spells" ASAP (low AP)
- Brenda & Madora have melee power stance always active
- Brenda's Best off-hand are mace levels 1-7, axe levels 11-22 (after tenebrium addition to 6% crit axes), and post lv 22 use Sword of Planets (with Joshua's Spice) or a 8% crit axe or Buffalo Sabre
- Will need 5 in charisma for pet pal talent + dialogue stuff

- Gear should all prioritize +1 primary stats.

Magical Starfish/Antlers/Eye + Leather Helm (+1 Leadership, +1 Con, +1 Per)

## Elemental rooms

1. Ice Elemental: the ice elemental is clearly the strongest beyond any doubt, having both Expert Marksman skills (including Vampiric Arrow, Rain of Arrows, etc.) as well as all of you water spells and water essence. Water and E.M. are the two strongest schools in the game and they both come on this elemental, as well as water essence producing the best grenade in game in the "Frost Grenade= water essence + empty grenade". Win-Win-Win.

2. Wind Elemental: Storm is nice but this is mostly taken for the scoundrel skills which this elemental sells as well, as well as Lightning Grenades = air essence + empty grenade. Those pesky novice skills are needed on everyone in your party and it can be hard to find them all, let alone early on- get the wind elemental 2nd to make sure you have all your scoundrel skills locked down asap, also as many lightning grenades as you can handle.

3. Earth Elemental: Earth has some of if not the weakest master level spells, but comes with Witchcraft, and some Witchcraft spells seem to be tricky to find, as well as the earthquake grenade = earth essence + empty grenade. Pick this one up next.

4. Fire Elemental: Meteor Shower frankly is not hard to get ahold of (or craft) and neither are any of the Man-at-Arms skills, as well as having the weakest grenade. Pick this up last due to the fact that you will most likely not even use Meteor Shower (other than with scrolls), that the Man-at-Arms skills are the easiest in game to acquire, and the fire essence + empty grenades producing the weakest of the four grenades.

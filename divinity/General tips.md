# Divinity: Tips

- Enemies with "immune to fire aura", try to sneak in to the battle and teleport the person with the aura into the middle of your party to start the fight.
- There is an oil barrel and an ooze barrel right outside the western gate of Cyseal where you find out the fate of the legion soldiers being sent to the lighthouse
- Water barrels can be found all over Cyseal
- use scrolls and forget about staffs/wands except for Ice wands or Staffs dealing with the "burning legion" near the start of the game
- craft grenades & special arrows early on (frost)
- hold on to +str items
- Pick up every single "cooking pot" you can find in the game (can be used to cover ANY trap vent)
- combine cooking pots with fires for a portable cooking situation
- You can get +2 to crafting/blacksmithing from belt & brancers. Jahan has a talent that gives +1 also, so he only needs 2/2 to be maxed
- *Burn my eyes* should be cast on your ranger at all times (spot traps & hidden treasure)
- Brenda should pick up all the "touching spells" ASAP (low AP)
- Brenda & Madora have melee power stance always active
- Brenda's Best off-hand are mace levels 1-7, axe levels 11-22 (after tenebrium addition to 6% crit axes), and post lv 22 use Sword of Planets (with Joshua's Spice) or a 8% crit axe or Buffalo Sabre
- Will need 5 in charisma for pet pal talent + dialogue stuff

## Gear

- As soon as possible make +1 Charisma gear:
  - Belt: Magical Tooth + Rope
  - Necklace: Magical Tooth + Thread
  - Rings: Magical Tooth + Ring Kits
- +1 dual weilding belt x2
- +1 two handed belt
- +1 leadership helm
- Immune to fear armor for madora
- +1 bow gloves, +1 bow

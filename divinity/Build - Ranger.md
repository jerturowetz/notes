# Build: Ranger

- Use a bow (and always make it +1, also +1 bow gloves)
- *Burn my eyes* should be cast on your ranger at all times (spot traps & hidden treasure)
- As soon as possible make +1 Charisma gear:
  - Belt: Magical Tooth + Rope
  - Necklace: Magical Tooth + Thread
  - Rings: Magical Tooth + Ring Kits
- Will need 5 in charisma for pet pal talent + dialogue stuff
- By the end of the game: Fighting from a distance as you will become a glass cannon with a bow and powerful magic. You wonâ€™t be using nearly as many elemental arrows by the end and basic physical attacks should rarely be used, if ever.

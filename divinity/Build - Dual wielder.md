# Build: Dual wielder

- always weild a dagger in main hand for scoundrel stuff
- pick up all the "touching spells" ASAP (low AP)
- have melee power stance always active
- Best weapons for other hand are mace levels 1-7, axe levels 11-22 (after tenebrium addition to 6% crit axes), and post lv 22 use Sword of Planets (with Joshua's Spice) or a 8% crit axe or Buffalo Sabre
- Stay back until the enemies are CC'd or weak and then jump in with thunder jump/battering ram and all your touch spells (burning/freezing/shocking/decaying, etc. touch).
- You should be throwing grenades like toilet paper- firestorm + toxic at a minimum- but grenades such as the frost grenade can make impossible fights pot shots.
- Spam Midnight Oil and then toss. Firefly will also help you with this.
- Enemies with "immune to fire aura", try to sneak in to the battle and teleport the person with the aura into the middle of your party to start the fight.
- By Mid-End game your spells will be powerful enough to take out most enemies, but you also can CC and destroy hand-to-hand with physical damage.

How to approach phase




## Drums

### Kick

Lows are at about 50-100hz - boost a bit here if you like - use a low cut too if you can
Cut mids 360-800 (depends on the sound of the kick - dump out that mid range that clouds up the mix)
Boost some attack around 2k-4k

Notes:

- Led Zepplin haz a lot of 1k in it and doesnt cut mid range
- Either notch out the bass or the kick in the place where you want the low low low

### Snare

Boost Low end is around 100-250hz
smack/tone is between 930-1.4k
7k ish snare wires

** Check phase on snare mic
** Gate snare wires

### Toms

might wanna pull the bleed down in between
dont wanna gate it out necess - just pull it down
put the toms back in phase with the OH


Filter 40hz & below
Cut mids 500hz for clarity

### Hat & Ride

Filter out 200hz & below

### Overheads

Filter 40hz and below - maybe 60, 90 a bit higher
this is a big deal when setting up phaze with the snare
but you wanna ull out the kick to avoid awkward phase issues
Around 100HZ is body and snare ooomph
Cut mids depending on style

### Crotch mic

hmm ?

## Bass

Record both a Bass DI & the amp
Tone from the amp / DI for whatever you might wanna change

Low end is 40hz-110hz. Rock is typically 60hz, dont boost 40hz but you might wanna leave it in

Dont be afraid to high pass

Neve EQ is good here

300hz is the low end for shit speakers

800hz - upper mids and tone comes from

1.6k-2k is top end, probably wanna find the top end and filter out guitars in the same space

Filter out top-top end

## Guitars

Never compress distorted electic guitars - they're already compresed

High pass around 50hz
woofy build up is at 140-150hz
Mids are about 400hz-1k - boost for a marshall
topend 3-4k
probably wanna filter out high end fizz
can end up filtering 8k or boosting 10k for shimmer

## Acoustic guitars

High pass 50hz

Mids are 2-2.6 k (this is piano zone so be careful)

maybe boost 10k for sparkle

Hey man,

You've been practicing the same beat and the same 3 fills non-stop for more than 3 years... If you're serious about wanting to start a band you need to be practicing new or, at the very least, different ideas. In general you seem to be practising often & consistently, which is awesome and shows more commitment than a lot of other musicians. If you applied yourself to new material with the same perseverance, I'm sure you'd be able to progress swiftly to a pro level.

There are a bunch of online resources you could explore like [drumeo](https://www.drumeo.com/), or, what I think is a better idea, is to take some lessons. There are a lot of good drum teachers in Montréal like [Maurice metailler](http://www.mauricemetayer.com/), [Vince Di Zazzo](http://www.montrealdrumlessons.com/) or [John McColgan](http://www.johnmccolgan.com/3/drumlessons.htm).

I hope this email doesn’t hurt your feelings too much; but, if even if it does, if it encourages you to hone your craft then it's achieved its goal. You're a hard worker and I think that's rare.

With respect,
Anonymous

P.S. this is a disposable email address so I can't receive any replies. If I've made you angry, use that energy to practice something new.

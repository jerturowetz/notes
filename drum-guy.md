Hey man,

I dont want to hurt your feelings but you've been practicing the same beat and the same 3 fills non-stop for more than 3 years. You sound like a record stuck on repeat...

If you're serious about wanting to start a band you need to be practicing new or different ideas.

You already practice often & pretty consistently, which is actually pretty awesome (and better than a lot of other muusicians). If you applied yourself to new material with the same perseverance, I'm sure you'd be able to progress swiftkly to a ppro level.

There are a bunch of online resourcese you could explore like drumeo, or, what I think is a better idea, is to take some lessons. There are alot of good drum teachers in montreal (maurice metailler for example).

I hope this email doesnt hurt your feelings too much; but, if even if it does, if it encourages you to hone your craft then it's acheived it's goal.

With respect,
Anonymous

P.S. this is a disposable email address so i can't recieve any replies. If I've made you angry, use that energy to practice something new.

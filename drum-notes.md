# Drum

## Head combinations

- **Snare batter:** Coated Pinstripe or PS3 (pop - Black Panther)
- **Snare batter:** X14 Coated or PS3 (rock - Starclassic)
- **Snare resonant:** Ambassador® Renaissance® Snare Side (lower tunings)
- **Snare resonant:** Ambassador® Hazy Snare Side (most popular standard)
- **Toms:** Coated Emperor / Ambassador or Emperor clear
- **Toms:** Ambassador X / Ambassador clear
- **Kick:** PS3 clear or Powersonic clear / Black Suede PS3

For snare reso, I've been using ambassador snare (I think) and its a bit muddy. As for snare wires im just using whatever, but the "rock" snare wires leave something to be desired (no definition - good for super muffled i guess).

I might tune the starclassic to be a hip hop drum with PS top & thick bottom & less snares

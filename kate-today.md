# About last night

"you continuye to do thr thing which makes ne pull back"
bro, no, thats not on me, you wanna bridge thr gap, get to workp yourself, dont blame me for not doing the work. pick up a hammer and fogute it out


"you acted like i ahot a puppy"
even after expressing that i frel like ny feelingsvwere mininized and dismissed youncontibuebto dismiss them becausr uou dont like their magnitude or toy jusge them as unbalanced re the input. i dont give a shit if yiu agree or not, but 36 jours latwr yoire atill cateless with my frelibgs and quick to ahift the conversation back to you
as to why its taking me a while to organize myself, and i ubderstand its an uncompfotable sotuationz, see above... unless im surgically clear on my own wants needs anf feeljbgs i have a pilenof evidence yhat that if uou feel theblitylest bit challenged, demonstrtaes im not gonna get enpathy abf in going to have to fight for understanding and im going to blamed, a bunch, for having unbalanced enotions, for bejng rresponaible for yhe tension" abd to blane for not resolving it, and just for being hard to talk to.
i know im not easy to talk yo abd i can go fron 1-100 in 2 seconds and i get ibsecure and guilty
but dude, WERE THE SAME
bringibg up me feeling upset with you 
make it clear thatbunless youvagree with thr levelbofvky enotional reaction, youre not going to treat is seriously, which ia ironic coming from yoy. maybe if you can figureboit how to acveot anvemotional reaction of mibe tou canvlearnbto accwptvuourbown
i know that i deserve that

"i cant talk to you"
dude, ibknow i go fron 0 to 100
but, from wherebim stabding, ita talking to you that causes trouble, gets me made fun of, makes me responsible
"its been 36 hours! i said waht i needed to, you havent said a word"
again, youre having a hard time dealing with me arrangibg my thought and dealing with thr silebce 
stop taking away my space to be upset!! everything here is abouy makjbbuou feel better
im not asking you yo read my mind, but id aprecaite yhat ifbi feel like shit and express as much that thw follow up isnt "what anout me" "what about me"


im difficult to talj to
dude, so are you
i havd a feeling that i get 0 supprt from yoy anf its 2 days of emotional labor and blame for not doing a better job
this whole situation isnorbitig around your motivation to place blame on how strong my reaction was, on my timeline for resolution, probably on youreelf too
what i berd you to try to do is to switch from teykng to find thr problem to "how do i feel and what do i need" and, ideally, "jow does jereny feel, what is he asking for, is ot reasonable, and what does he need"
id be happy with just thr former



even now, 2 days later, ibstead of takin a second to empathise uoute teying to blame me for beibg harc to speak with... how is this helpful? what arr tou tryibg tobexpress? that because my enotions run high i shouldnforget them



Last night I expressed that I didnt feel good in reaction to something you said. Your response to this expression was a short word, a mildly aggressive action and to leave the room.

Already upset and now feeling ignored/dimissed, I chose to clear my head by taking a ealk which led tonyoy feeling upset that I didn't want to talk.

why would i want to talk? i had literally just troed that and it got me feeling shittier than when i started and you upset

How do I get understanding or empathy from you if talking to you about it drives your defensjveness? How can i be construvtive or in a situation like this?

I dont know, but i wanted and needed to have space to feel ipset abd had a desired to be heard abd I didnt feel like I was going to get it at home; rather, I felt that my feelings were going to be dismissed as irrational or overly sensirive and/or encouter defensiveness and guilt and make my sadness about your guilt which i feel happened anyway

when i was leaving, I felt that the only reason you wanted to talk then was to waylay your own upset state, not address how I was feeling. Language like "now you're punishing me" seems to me to validate that your primary concerns were your own feelings and mine, like the fact that i felt so upset i wanted to walk ot off, irrelevan to you.

On my return your shutting down and leaving the room made it clear that if I wanted to communicate I'd need to dig for it. My attempts to communicate werent great, but I felt like you were trying to widen the gap, not bridge it, putting the presure of resolution on me.

and all this because I initially felt hurt

so the message i got was feel hurt >> express it >> east shit

for the record i wsnt good when i came back. i just didnt want to fight, which, considerin how upset i am and how defensive toy get didnt sedm ppssible

## Today

Moreso, what was about me being upset very quickly transformed into "us" being upset.

and i hate that that happened without at all addressing the fact that i was initoally hurt

today you renain unempathwtic and diamissive 

"i felt like you overreacted to my use of the words 'common sense'"

i feel tired having my unhappiness simultanioisly dismissse and co-opted

i didnt overreact, i reacted and expressed how i was feelibg ptetty clearly i think. im not amazing at it but im not bad

i think i have a right to react
and fedl hurt pr be upset

I also dont like the fact that you said "we got heated"
We didnt get heated
I got heated
and then, without trying to empathise or understand
you got defensive
and now it feels like youve written off my frdlings me off as overreactibg or sensiive
and now minimizing my feelings

The whole situation makes me feel like I dont have space to be upset

not just that but if indovget upset id better keepbit to muself ptherwise im going to have to assuage your guilt

the core of your whole communication today is yo tou tou 


## Things I want to communicate

minimizing my feelings because you dont approve of them after evaluation, that sucks 


I need to have space to be upset without needing to make you feel better about it
if I ever say anything that challenges you id like to be able to wxpect empathy, eventually if npt right away
if I express that I'm upset about something treat it woth respect rather than dismissing me
if uiu feel challenged by me, react away but at sone point try to enpathise rather that fpcusing on you
Don't judge my feelings or toss them away
If theres a gap between us as a reauly pg conflict, pleaae try to meet me halfway with bridging it
When I am upset about something, I deserve the space to feel that way, whether you approve of why or not
When I am upset I expect you to treat me with respect
How rarely I need space to be upset, I dont appreciate it being taken away













how is this talking?

You're surprised I want to take my time?

You said you didnt like our arguments
and, whatever faults I have aside,

your argument style fucking sucks

its all blame and poor-me

after i told you i felt ignored and dismissed
you told me Im hard to talk to...

all i want is like 2 seconds of empathy

I want you to think "Hey, maybe if he's this upset I can try to imane what he's going through"

and if you cant do that

at least dont make me do a ton of emotional work because you cant deal with the fact that I on vary rare occasions get pissed of

I got made and now I need to manage your feelings
and it still feels like you havent spent a second on mine
if only for formality
so we can move back to how youve been affected by my mood

I want my mood addressed

I wanna have space to be upset
and, just like I dont shit on you when you get upset, despite howerver insecure it makes me feel
dont shit on me

If you could just say "Wow, I cant imagine why hes so upset, let me try to undertsbnad a litte"
rather than:
"Its been 36 hours I told you how I felt and you still havent said anything"
"You acted like I shot a puppy"
"I can't talk to you"
and the occasional sarcastic remarks

rather than fixating on how YOU'RE having a hard time dealing with the tension
rather than blaming me for forcing you to retrea (thats on you man)
rather than putting the burden of bridging the gap on me

Im happy to help in all those things and meet you halfway
But first I need to feel like I'm being listeend toand
your initial reaction, your refusal to let me take a walk to deal with feeling, you're making my feelings and my need for space all about you and, this miorning, your language and demands make it pretty clear that you are not at all concerned by how I feel, but only by how my feelings are presently affecting you
I need evidence that your are trying to empathise and you can put your guilt aside so that I can have space
and I dont feel I need to owe you an explanation or emotional labor when I want to take a walk anymore than you owe me an explanation any time you stomp your foot
I want empathy, I want it first and I want youto show me you can give it to me without making me feel bad about having a feeling
because I dont do that to you



youre upset that im taking my time to speak to you
yet you almost immediately respond to my speaking to you with blame, shame


I need empathy right now
its all i needed in the first place
I need to feel like you're trying to empathise with me
and not shooting me shade
I need you to TRY to help me talk to you
without getting blamed and shamed



Kate, I'm not super difficult to talk to

I apologgizee for things I dont want to apologize for and reflect on things I find difficult reflecting on
This is not in my nature
it takes effort
and I think it demonstrates love

I need you to do the same right now

The only apologies ive ever gotten from you are guilty ones, and thats selfish

I want a real apology here
I wan you to recognize that I had a feeling, you ignored it and since youve been challenging my right to feel upset and making it all about how it affects you

is not constructuive

whats your goal?
What result do you want?

It fucking sucks that I have to do this work when all i wanted twas to be heard

BTW one of the big reasons our fights suck is because you're techniques are exclusively dismissive blame and poor-me, if you could, for a seconsd, try and just focus on how i feel I promise you we'd make headway


## What I want

I dont think you have a lot of practice with emotional language. I think one of the major reasons our arguments suck is because your argument technique is shitty. Instead of trying to express things you blame others or fall in to self-pity.

I see you do this at work and with your mom and wherever else

and in situations where you have opportunities to practice empathy, you engage in what you already know, feeling sorry for yourself and blaming others around for whatever

I'm not saying all this as an attack. It's fine and I have plenty of eprsonal issues myself which are difficult to deal with.

But I'm saying all this to be really clear:

I think one of the major reasons our fights suck is because you are terrible at empathy
and your default actions are defensive blame and self-pity
and it makes you a difficult person to communicate with about anything I fear might trigger these

this mornign is a perfect example

here you are, desperate fto resolve the distance between us, yet when a conversation in forced you shoot out nothing but blame and shame:
"Its been 36 hours I told you how I felt and you still havent said anything"
and then when I try to express myself i get:
the occasional sarcastic remark
whatevers
"You acted like I shot a puppy"
"This is why I can't talk to you"

its the same technique over and over
and it feels really shit to be on the receiving end of it.




and there very little personal emotional expression of needs and, the thing bothering me right now, is a lack of empathy which you never practice and you could really use especially when youre being hard on yourself.

But right now you're being hard on me
"Its been 36 hours I told you how I felt and you still havent said anything"
and then when I try to express myself i get:
"You acted like I shot a puppy"
"This is why I can't talk to you"
and the occasional sarcastic remark

why do you think Im taking my time to talk to you?

its like fucking mining

and if im not extremely accurate in what I want Im gonna have no way to fight the waves of defensive guilt and blame I KNOW are coming



/////////////



its really difficult for me to expres things, it takes me a while
in addition you dont make it easy
if you cant see why i have a hard time engaging in conflict with you, here's this morning, to me:

you can't feel like someone ovvereacted
but thats not a feeling, its a judgment about a feeling
and its dismissive
and disempowering and disrespectful

and of course you can feel how you feel about my wanting to take a walk
blame me for not wanting to talk
despite the fact that it should be clear you are really difficult to talk to if you feel challenged

but that came way after the initial being ignored
and it comes without reflection on why i wanted to take a wlk in the first place
and the only reason you want me to talk in that instance is for you
not for me

All i needed was a moment of empathy
honestly thats all i still need
I want to feel like you can put your defensiveness aside (even if it takes a few minutes)
and just think "gee, he must be really upset, let me try to undersnad why"
instyead of dismising or challenging me




and that when i do
or when its forced
that i get minimized and ignored or blamed sucks
and yeah that happened initially
but it continues to happened
this morning
you forced a conversaion because youre having ahard time dealing with tension





When we argue
I try to ask myself questions like
what can I learn
and
what is kate feeling
and
what do i want
and how do i acheive that

and this time I feel like the reason this fight isnt going to go anywhere is because youre not asking yourself those questions
I dont feel like you are makign any attempt to try and undertsnad me, be permissive with my being upset or empathetic to my expression

In fact Im getting the opposite
Youre having a hard time dealing with tension in the environment
yet when conversaion is forced you give me blame and self-pity


and this is the same reason i wanted to go on a walk the other night


which, for the record, i no more need to validate to you than you need to validate your anger to me the next time you stomp your foot
and that youre demanding it is irksome
So whats the message there? any time i might get upset I need to make sure youre feelings are handled?











It's no wonder you dont like our fights
Your argument style is to blame
All i need
all i needed in the first place
was for you to think
"how dioes he feel"
and all of these staements 
seemed aimed at the opposite
seem aimed at making me feel your pain
and reflect nothing on mine





How often do I get upset?
How often do I need room to express it?
This makes me feel like the cost of doing so is high.
Youre not the only one who gets to be angry
and I deserve, at least a little, tolerance udnerstanding and support on the rare occasion that I am

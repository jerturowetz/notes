# About last night

Last night I expressed that I didnt feel good in reaction to something you said. Your response to this expression was a short word, a mildly aggressive action and to leave the room.

Already upset and now feeling ignored/dimissed, I decided to go out to try and clear my head and you got upset I didn't want to talk.

How do you talk to a person about how you feel upset by something they said/did when talking to them about it upsets them? How do you get understanding or empathy in this situation? How do you feel better or make them feel less devensive? I dont know. All I know is that I was feeling shitty and I wanted empathy and to be lisetend to and I didnt feel like I was going to get it at home; rather, I felt that my feelings were going to be dismissed as irrational or inconvenient and/or encouter defensiveness and guilt.

I also felt that the only reason you wanted to talk to me on my way out was to waylay your own upset state, not address how I was feeling. Language like "now you're punishing me" seems to me to validate that your primary concerns were your own feelings.

On my return your shutting down and leaving the room made it clear that if I wanted to communicate I'd need to dig for it. My attempts to communicate werent great, but I felt like you were trying to widen the gap, not bridge it, putting the presure of resolution on me.

## Today

you would like to talk
about what, I dont know
pushing me to do emotional labor
putting a price tag on my being upset
and my original qualm continues to be dismissed as an ovverreaction
This makes me feel tired
I feel like its being co-opted
I dont like the fact that you said "we got heated"
We didnt get heated
I got heated
and then, without trying to empathise or understand
you got defensive
and you took it away from me
and now minimizing and dismissing my feelings
"i felt like you overreacted to my use of the words 'common sense'"
Today, you continue to be dismissive and wont attempt to empathise. "i felt like you overreacted to my use of the words 'common sense'"
I reacted kate
I didnt like what you said
and I reacted
in a pretty tame way
where i communicated it
I was then punished for it
and now I'm getting the vibe of
"you're too sensitive Turowetz"
Such staments make me feel like my emotions are an inconvenience
and The whole situation makes me feel like I dont have space to be upset

## Things I want to communicate

I feel like I don't get to have space to be upset without needing to make you feel better about it.
if I ever say anything that challenges you I can expect combat not empathy.
So what I'm getting from you is:

- Jer's upset for unimportant / overreactive reasons
- This upsets Kate
- Jer needs to fix the situation
and i dont appreciate my reaction being minimized and my space to be angry co-opted

## What I need is

I want your help, and in this case I think you're making it more difficult.
Try to empathize with me if I express that I'm upset about something
Don't judge my feelings or toss them away
If you're upset that I'm upset, meet me halfway with bridging that gap and reestablishing communication
Don't take my expression of upset away
When I am upset about something, I deserve the space to feel that way, whether you approve of why or not
When I am upset I expect you to treat me with respect
How rarely I need space to be upset, I dont appreciate it being taken away

////



Moreso, what was about me being upset very quickly transformed into "us" being upset.
without you getting mad or making a situation which was about me, about you
given space about expressing being upset
has now turned in to an us conversation
I find that unfair
I continue to feel dismissed and unheard.

when im feeling like shit i dont wanna have to dig for empathy and then 
get hit with guilt when i ont

we didnt need to talk
I needed to be empathised with
or listened to
or heard out
and now, the next day, still nothing beyond "i felt like you overreacted to my use of the words 'common sense'"
I reacted
and didnt feel good
and thats fair
and I deserve to have space to do that
and I should be able to expect you, after whatever initial reaction, to try an empathize with me
"i felt like you overreacted to my use of the words 'common sense'"
is not an attempt to empathize
its an evaluation and dismissal of my feelings (and not by me)
they're to be treated lightly
It makes me feel very small

# About last night

"you continuye to do thr thing which makes ne pull back"
bro, no, thats not on me, you wanna bridge thr gap, get to workp yourself, dont blame me for not doing the work. pick up a hammer and fogute it out


"you acted like i ahot a puppy"
even after expressing that i frel like ny feelingsvwere mininized and dismissed youncontibuebto dismiss them becausr uou dont like their magnitude or toy jusge them as unbalanced re the input. i dont give a shit if yiu agree or not, but 36 jours latwr yoire atill cateless with my frelibgs and quick to ahift the conversation back to you
as to why its taking me a while to organize myself, and i ubderstand its an uncompfotable sotuationz, see above... unless im surgically clear on my own wants needs anf feeljbgs i have a pilenof evidence yhat that if uou feel theblitylest bit challenged, demonstrtaes im not gonna get enpathy abf in going to have to fight for understanding and im going to blamed, a bunch, for having unbalanced enotions, for bejng rresponaible for yhe tension" abd to blane for not resolving it, and just for being hard to talk to.
i know im not easy to talk yo abd i can go fron 1-100 in 2 seconds and i get ibsecure and guilty
but dude, WERE THE SAME
bringibg up me feeling upset with you 
make it clear thatbunless youvagree with thr levelbofvky enotional reaction, youre not going to treat is seriously, which ia ironic coming from yoy. maybe if you can figureboit how to acveot anvemotional reaction of mibe tou canvlearnbto accwptvuourbown
i know that i deserve that

"i cant talk to you"
dude, ibknow i go fron 0 to 100
but, from wherebim stabding, ita talking to you that causes trouble, gets me made fun of, makes me responsible
"its been 36 hours! i said waht i needed to, you havent said a word"
again, youre having a hard time dealing with me arrangibg my thought and dealing with thr silebce 
stop taking away my space to be upset!! everything here is abouy makjbbuou feel better
im not asking you yo read my mind, but id aprecaite yhat ifbi feel like shit and express as much that thw follow up isnt "what anout me" "what about me"


im difficult to talj to
dude, so are you
i havd a feeling that i get 0 supprt from yoy anf its 2 days of emotional labor and blame for not doing a better job
this whole situation isnorbitig around your motivation to place blame on how strong my reaction was, on my timeline for resolution, probably on youreelf too
what i berd you to try to do is to switch from teykng to find thr problem to "how do i feel and what do i need" and, ideally, "jow does jereny feel, what is he asking for, is ot reasonable, and what does he need"
id be happy with just thr former



even now, 2 days later, ibstead of takin a second to empathise uoute teying to blame me for beibg harc to speak with... how is this helpful? what arr tou tryibg tobexpress? that because my enotions run high i shouldnforget them



Last night I expressed that I didnt feel good in reaction to something you said. Your response to this expression was a short word, a mildly aggressive action and to leave the room.

Already upset and now feeling ignored/dimissed, I chose to clear my head by taking a ealk which led tonyoy feeling upset that I didn't want to talk.

why would i want to talk? i had literally just troed that and it got me feeling shittier than when i started and you upset

How do I get understanding or empathy from you if talking to you about it drives your defensjveness? How can i be construvtive or in a situation like this?

I dont know, but i wanted and needed to have space to feel ipset abd had a desired to be heard abd I didnt feel like I was going to get it at home; rather, I felt that my feelings were going to be dismissed as irrational or overly sensirive and/or encouter defensiveness and guilt and make my sadness about your guilt which i feel happened anyway

when i was leaving, I felt that the only reason you wanted to talk then was to waylay your own upset state, not address how I was feeling. Language like "now you're punishing me" seems to me to validate that your primary concerns were your own feelings and mine, like the fact that i felt so upset i wanted to walk ot off, irrelevan to you.

On my return your shutting down and leaving the room made it clear that if I wanted to communicate I'd need to dig for it. My attempts to communicate werent great, but I felt like you were trying to widen the gap, not bridge it, putting the presure of resolution on me.

and all this because I initially felt hurt

so the message i got was feel hurt >> express it >> east shit

for the record i wsnt good when i came back. i just didnt want to fight, which, considerin how upset i am and how defensive toy get didnt sedm ppssible

## Today

Moreso, what was about me being upset very quickly transformed into "us" being upset.

and i hate that that happened without at all addressing the fact that i was initoally hurt

today you renain unempathwtic and diamissive 

"i felt like you overreacted to my use of the words 'common sense'"

i feel tired having my unhappiness simultanioisly dismissse and co-opted

i didnt overreact, i reacted and expressed how i was feelibg ptetty clearly i think. im not amazing at it but im not bad

i think i have a right to react
and fedl hurt pr be upset

I also dont like the fact that you said "we got heated"
We didnt get heated
I got heated
and then, without trying to empathise or understand
you got defensive
and now it feels like youve written off my frdlings me off as overreactibg or sensiive
and now minimizing my feelings

The whole situation makes me feel like I dont have space to be upset

not just that but if indovget upset id better keepbit to muself ptherwise im going to have to assuage your guilt

the core of your whole communication today is yo tou tou 


## Things I want to communicate

minimizing my feelings because you dont approve of them after evaluation, that sucks 


I need to have space to be upset without needing to make you feel better about it
if I ever say anything that challenges you id like to be able to wxpect empathy, eventually if npt right away
if I express that I'm upset about something treat it woth respect rather than dismissing me
if uiu feel challenged by me, react away but at sone point try to enpathise rather that fpcusing on you
Don't judge my feelings or toss them away
If theres a gap between us as a reauly pg conflict, pleaae try to meet me halfway with bridging it
When I am upset about something, I deserve the space to feel that way, whether you approve of why or not
When I am upset I expect you to treat me with respect
How rarely I need space to be upset, I dont appreciate it being taken away

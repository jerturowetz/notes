## Priority gear

Tarp for the car ride
Tree bag
Tree stand
Tree Spout
Water additives for tree
Plaid cover for bottom
Multi-outlet ext cord (green)
green twist-ums
Tourette / Wooden wire reel

## Check the tree before we buy

Bring a tape measure
Bring the base
Grab a branch and pull lightly, needles shouldn't fall off
Needles should be squishy and not snap
Get something about 7ft-8ft (we have a ladder)

## Tree prep at home

Cut the bottom off straight
Use a 1/2' bit to make some holes around the trunk

## Decorating

10 stands electric lights
Ornaments
Tree skirt / fake snow

# Cheat sheet : Typography

From Matej Latin's typography lessons

## Type size & colour

- A common rule for setting the body text is to set it to a size that would match the size of the text in a book at an arm's length distance
- 16px for mobile and from 18 to 22 px for desktop is a good general rule; however, this may be different depending on the typeface
- _Type colour_ means how heavy black type on a light background looks like (independant of weight)

## Line width (measure)

- The ideal width of a line of text is from 45 to 75 characters—including spaces. 

## Line-height (leading)

- Too many designers or web developers think of line-height as an isolated text feature, so they tend to set it based on what _seems_ right. Consequently, line-height tends to get set without too much consideration.
- For paragraphs, ideal line-height is usually between 1.3 and 1.6 (a body text set at 16px should have a line-height from 21 to 26 px); but will depend on the things mentioned earlier: typeface design, type size, weight etc.
- Headings are usually much shorter so they need to have less space between the lines so they don't look like they're drifting apart. Recommended line-height for headings is from 1 to 1.2 so a heading set at 24 px will need a line-height from 24 to 29 px. This may seem a bit ridiculous at first but try it. Once you see the difference you can't unsee it. _Note that in languages that use capital letters more than others (German for example), it’s recommended to use a larger line-height._

## X-height and type color

Typefaces with a taller x-height are considered modern and easier to read. Merriweather, Roboto Slab and Freight Text are great examples of modern serifed typefaces with a large x-height.

Typefaces with a smaller x-height are considered less modern and classical. Great examples include typefaces like Garamond, Baskerville and Bodoni.

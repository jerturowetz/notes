Run FNIS

MCM
Of the 6 groups available in the MCM you can choose to have none or all active at the same time.
For each group you have four options. I play as a female character so here's how the MCM options relate to my choices.

Only Player - This group of idle animations only affect the player
Only same sex - This group of animations only affect female followers
Players - This group of animations only affect female followers and the female player
Others - This group of animations only effect male followers

If you play as a male then it looks like this

Only Player - This group of idle animations only affect the player
Only same sex - This group of animations only affect male followers
Players - This group of animations only affect male followers and the male player
Others - This group of animations only effect female followers

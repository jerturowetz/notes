Hi Lacey,

Due to changes in the WP Engine product model, I am adjusting my hosting model to ensure that clients retain ownership over their products (websites) and needn't share resources. To this end, I will be shutting down my shared WP Engine hosting, where I have all clients bundled together, and moving you to your own privately held account.

For you, this means that:

- You'll have full availability of resources on a single account
- You will be paying WP Engine directly, rather than through us
- You will have access to server-side analytics data provided by WP Engine
- You will have access to the new WP Engine content monitoring (at whatever cost for the tool is, if you opt in)
- Your actual hosting service won't be affected in any way
- You will need to adjust your domain records within 30 days of the change (I can do this)

As I presently don't charge you service fees, you won't really be seeing any change in price. We might actually help you save a few dollars the first year by asking our rep to provide coupons on the annual plan. In addition, the migration process is quite simple and will be done free of charge.

The only step I need to coordinate is the setup of your new account before the current hosting term ends in December, which will require a valid credit card and company billing details. I can do this for you or we can walk you through the process.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to give me a call. If not, let's see about getting you set up as soon as is convenient.

Best,
Jeremy

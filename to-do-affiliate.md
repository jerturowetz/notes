Hi there,

I'm writing as I've been having significant issues receiving payment for an approved transaction from ShareASale. Beyond my general dissatisfaction with the platform (a website over a decade old, no form validation when entering direct deposit info etc.), my support requests don't seem to be treated seriously. More specifically, I have been trying to get information to resolve a direct deposit payment issue and receive payment on a transaction from July of this year, and, as I have several payments which will be getting unlocked next month, I am concerned I am going to have issues collecting those payments as well.

To get you up to speed on why I am frustrated, please find below the timeline of my interactions with ShareASale. Wherever I've noted a ticket, you'll find the ticket number which corresponds to pdfs I've attached to this email so that you might review yourself and make your own judgments.

- 2018-07-17 I refer a client to WPEngine & the sale is registered on the ShareASale platform (Transaction ID: 109430381)
- 2018-09-20 My payment unlocks and is "sent"
- 2018-09-27 My payment is rejected due to invalid banking info (totally my mistake, aside: how ShareASale doesn't have basic form validation in 2018 is absurd). I immediately fixed the account info and resend.
- 2018-09-30 First ticket opened asking how long repayments take (MCE-172827)
- 2018-10-02 ShareASale advises payments take a few days (MCE-172827)
- 2018-10-05 ShareASale system states the payment has been resent (aside: this took more than a week... looks like they only process once a week)
- 2018-10-14 I respond to my ticket and ask if its normal for payments to take so long as it has been about 10 days (MCE-172827)
- 2018-10-17 ShareASale advises they had a "delay"(?) and payments were only sent out on the 12th. I am told to wait (MCE-172827 & beginning of SVW-116744)
- 2018-10-23 I reach out expressing frustration that no one has followed up & still no payment (SVW-116744)
- 2018-10-23 ShareASale tells me to keep waiting (SVW-116744)
- 2018-10-29 I open a new ticket advising still no payment received (MCE-172827). _At this point it has been 17 days since the 12th, over a month since the initial correction_
- 2018-11-01 ShareASale notes my issue, apologizes and states they will try to resolve it (MCE-172827)
- 2018-11-02 Without consulting me and without any type of notification, ShareASale cancels my DD and mails out a cheque. They do not follow up, I learn of this only because I am logging and checking the platform daily. There is an obscure message about why the DD failed ("Unable to locate Account").
- 2018-11-02 I complain about the lack of communication and request more information about the DD issue as I have future payments pending (MCE-172827)
- 2018-11-06 ShareASale apologizes again, advises the payment issue had something to do with file formats (how is this my problem) and advises they sent me a cheque (MCE-172827)
- 2018-11-06 I respond asking for clarification on the DD issue and how it can be resolved (MCE-172827) - no response
- 2018-11-13 I ask again how can I resolve my DD issue (MCE-172827) - no response
- 2018-11-15 I ask if there's any tracking for the cheque (MCE-172827) - no response
- 2018-11-19 (TODAY) I opened a new ticket complaining that I have still not received anything and am still awaiting a response. _As this point, it has been 17 days since they mailed out the cheque & over a month since the payment reissue_

I understand that you cannot provide technical support for a platform that you do not control; however, I am writing with the hope that you might be able to put pressure on ShareASale and also perhaps present my issue to a WPEngine accounts manager so that they might see how horrible this experience has been for me.

I like WPEngine, have been a client for several years and have recommended your services even before I began as an affiliate; but, if collecting payments remains this excruciating, I'm going to move my clients over to a platform where I can benefit without headaches - likely Patreon where I have neve had an issue.

Anyway, thanks for your time and your attention to this issue which really shouldn't be your issue. Any help you can provide to expedite things with ShareASale would be appreciated and I hope my bringing this issue to your attention can benefit future partnerships.

Best,
Jeremy

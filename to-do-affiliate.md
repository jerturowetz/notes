hi there

im having pretty significant issues
getting share a sale to process affiliate payments

this is bot a question of approvig payjebts, the payments are all registered pn my affiliat a count


the paynebts have all been approved and released

it is simply that they keep havib "issues" with paying me and are quite difficultto get a hold of (they  repond to suppry tickes maybe anout half the time and itvtakes a bout abweek to get any attention


the rought tineline is this:
make a sale
wait forbit to clear
paymebt processing failed (my fault) - why yhey do t have basix valudation is ibsane
fixed payme t details, a weeks later says its being processes 
waiting a while open a ticket , rep tells ne to wait nore
wait sone more open a tickey rep tells me they had trchibcal issue ls and i need to wait nore
open  3rd ticked, rep tells me oops looks like your oaynebt was ib limbo, innediatly issues the payment by mail (i did bot want a paymebt byvmail) ifnores questions about reaolivibg dd
poat a follwonup, am ignoted
post a follow ip, continue to br ignored

ao i am reaxhin out to you

i have annoyet 1200$ about to clear and while its not a ton or clients it does represent 6 accounts which ideserve to get paid fr.

i am really nervous im bot going to see a oenny for anybof these at this poibt and need your help to tesolve thisbisse

additionally id urgeh you to change addiliate oaynebt portals these peiple at share a sale are imposaible
and this has been a really fristrating experience (i mean they only do 1 thing and theyre really bot doing it wrll)

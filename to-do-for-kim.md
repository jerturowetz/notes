# Q&A for Kim

I greatly appreciate the time and thoughtfulness you're putting into this. While it's not a long traditional ceremony, to me it will be an important transformative moment in my life and I feel fortunate to have you performing it with demonstrated care and interest.

Sorry it's taken a while to get back to you, these questions are DEEP bro.

1) We met on Tinder. Kate's written profile was tongue in cheek and while interesting, not terribly informative. Her phots were similar maybe more playful. I found this mysterious and intriguing.

2) I don’t remember my first impression of Kate. Personally, I feel that the record of a person I hold in my mind is the mean of the whole of my experience with them. At best I can remember what I was experiencing around the time I first met Kate: I enjoyed her playfulness, I wanted to learn more about her and I wanted to spend more time around her. The latter was especially because I felt comfortable in a way I found novel which resulted in an opportunity for me to honest in a way I don't think most people comfortably can.

3) Some things about Kate I enjoy:

- Her smarts
- Her deep well of emotion (which she claims to not have)
- Her lips & legs & other things not for you
- Her interest and ability to pick up new things quickly and with conviction (gardening/photoshop/wood care)

4) Kate can occasionally experience abrupt changes in mood which, beyond being a pain in the ass for her, can catch me off guard and impact me emotionally in a way she might not always recognize. I find it challenging to be a stabilizing force, afford her space to ask for help or give her space to address issues on her own while also remaining assertive of my own needs.

Over the last two years, we've each been working on ourselves and there's been evidence that we've both grown in our capacity as partners. I think just keeping up with our approaches and asking for help from each other and outside forces when we need it will continue to result in a better and better shared experience.

5) I think we both carry around a lot of outside fear or a sense of lost connection. Before we met I think we were both searching for (or had given up searching for) a sense of freedom or release. I think we found this safest of spaces in each other in a way neither of us expected.

6) The best that I can I hope. I think the techniques which yield the most substantial returns are those driven by self examination (i.e. what can I do? how can I change? what can I bring to the table?) as they guarantee I'm always providing something (money, patience, letting go, etc.). Totally open to suggestions on this one.

7) We have fun all the time together. One of our favorite things is going to the grocery store. Kate is silly - just look at her. I like how serious she gets about not serious things (she really loves our garbage can). And she likes a good adventure though she'd be loathe to admit it. I tend to make myself laugh a lot round her and then she laughs at me. Specific situations that involve fun are our observations of other people’s dogs.

8) Kate will pet me or look me in the eye, but really look me in the eye, like as if to let me know I belong in the same space as her and it helps me to feel valuable and respected. Those moment make me feel a part of.

9) There's no favorite but one of the tops is dancing in the kitchen or dancing in the bedroom just because a slow song is playing. We've done it to Whitesnake, Chris du Burgh and many more. When this happens its like the whole world slows down and we exist outside it and are paying attention to its center.

# Cult Mtl :: Examples & reference

Below you'll find an updated version of a list I originally shared with Lorraine & Tim at our first meeting. Although I've included links for future sections like categories and galleries, those will likely change as we progress.

## Current Website for reference

- [CULT Mtl - Single post](http://cultmontreal.com/2017/08/coogan-and-brydon-trip-to-spain/)
- [CULT Mtl - Category](http://cultmontreal.com/music-nightlife/)

## Article design reference

### [NY Times - Featured article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/07/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-drugs-killings.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur)

Love the simplicity, centered text between 45-70 em wide
Ads should appear as banners (see current site)

### [The Outline - Article](https://theoutline.com/post/2388/google-is-really-good-at-design)

Navigation simplicity (we have a lot more cats but i like this - especially with the social links in the nav)
Same idea with max width on content
Cannot do fun stuff in titles
Look at the bottom - theres a nice signup form
Look at the bottom - the articles keep feeding in a cool way (max width, articles in the same category)

[This time they have a share arrow up top - maybe we could do a share arrow and a hamburger to full screen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/jobs/nyt-52-places-the-trip.html?src=twr)

# Cult Mtl :: Examples & reference

Iâ€™m thinking BKDSNs top priority for the CULT Mtl redesign are articles. By articles I mean any single consumable items; such as individual posts, galleries or single event listings.

I'm thinking what we need to pay attention to are:

- Hero images & title handling
- Related stories modules
- Ad handling
- Sidebar design
- Metadata (author, tags, cats, breadcrumbs)

Below you'll find an updated version of a list I originally shared with Lorraine & Tim at our first meeting. Although I've included links for future sections like categories and galleries, those will likely change as we progress.

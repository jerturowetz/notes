# BKDSN: A workflow for modern web development

This document is my attempt to give form to what can sometimes feel like an overwhelming number of tasks to keep in mind when building web sites. I feel I need this document because, as a web developer who works mostly unsupervised, I have a lot to keep in mind.

This guide was created to help developers, designers, clients and managers approach web development projects effectively and with transparency. Properly architected projects enable clients to understand, set and achieve project goals in a meaningful way and help creators provide accurate estimates and deliver results in manageable chunks.

[Skip straight to the guide](#Workflow)

## A vision for modern web development

I am of the mind that treating websites as a commodity keeps agencies prisoner to low quality products. In bill-by-the-hour work, it pays to work slower, put out bad code and draw out processes. In such scenarios clients are left unhappy, there's no repeat business and web products aren't innovative.

Delivering professional web services (instead of web sites), clients become product owners the moment they have a vision, creators get to push this vision in new directions and aspects of development can be modularized to be added to or removed based on project needs. Such scenarios encourage innovation and, happy clients will return to continue to forward their project vision as business needs grow and change.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to remove any guesswork from the "ok, what next?" question when building web properties in the 100k range (starting at 15-30k). It also aims to address common project issues, such as:

- Not giving/getting regular feedback from stakeholders leads to drastic scope change when stakeholders pop-in
- Proposals made with set deadlines/budget before discovery period change dramatically as details emerge
- Clients don't anticipate necessary level of commitment & are not available for high demand sections of projects (content collection, training) slowing things down
- Clients expect to be able to deliver assets (catalogues, writeups, translations) but not in a professional capacity, which lowers project value
- Unplanned content migrations & unexpected technical requirements lead to expensive development bulk

Clients can use this guide to better understand what they can expect, in terms of pricing and timelines, and what will be expected of them (to either provide or defer). Creators can use this as a general workflow guide and managers can use this guide to help define budgets and improve processes to better suit client and business needs.

This guide is meant to be used in AGILE-like environments - which will also save you a ton of headaches - so get on that.

**Aspects of my ideal web project: **

- Billable discovery period during which clients obtain valuable research and content inventories are conducted shaves time and stress
- Instead of websites sold as products, web strategy is sold as a high-value service
- Modular, value based pricing lets all sizes of clients participate and anticipate
- Require stakeholder participation or decision-making authority granted to project liaison streamlines workflow
- Dedicated client liaison to provide defined support reduces bottlenecks
- Proposal are for relationship, not project
- Projects begin with prototypes
- Scope managed

## Workflow

The following is a _work in progress_ and is subject to change. Edits, comments and contributions are welcome.

### STEP 1: Initial phone call & questionnaire (free)

#### General questions

- What’s the lifespan of the project?
- Is there a timeline for delivery?
- What's your budget?
- Is there an existing site?
- Who will be the primary responsible party for the project (in house, no one, BKDSN)?

#### Strategy

- What is the properties’ target audience?
- What is the project's main goal?
- Are there metrics and data re site speed & users?
- Who are your top competitors?
- How will SEO review & upkeep be managed?

#### Design

- Does the project have core branding & content guidelines?
- Are there web-specific brand assets already developed or does a site identity need to be built (icons, color guides, buttons, forms)?
- What should it look like (bare bones, stock, beautiful & unique)?

#### Content

- What languages need to be supported?
- Is the project content dynamic?
- Will there be frequent updates? If so, by whom?
- How will content be managed/handled?

#### Development

- What platforms need to be supported (iOS, android, browsers & browser support)?
- Does the project need to connect to other services (internal/external)?
- Will there be e-commerce components? Can you describe them? Who will manage this?
- Will people need to log in? If so, how (email, social)?
- Will there be ratings or reviews?
- Will there be any other live interactions?

### STEP 2: Discovery (2 weeks, $3000)

- Review questionnaire answers
- Conduct client-facing business objectives survey (**need**)
- Conduct client-facing design objectives survey (**need**)

#### Agency Meeting #1

- Share surveys
- Define project priorities
- Assign prelim tasks & point people

#### Prepare for Client meeting

- Review competitors’ sites and note strengths/weaknesses
- Assemble links & sketches for ref
- Make a presentation template (**need**)

#### Client meeting #1

- Distribute priorities
- Discuss project goals
- Show ref links
- Assess target audience
- Define budgets
- Set point-people
- Describe agency work process
- Set up work expectations

#### Agency Meeting #2 (immediately)

- Outline general plan
- Identify any remaining questions
- Distribute meeting notes via email & any additional questions to client

#### Planning & Work Proposal

- Assign agency team: design, development, content (integral, external)
- Assign client team: stakeholder or decision-making power with time available for project
- Request & obtain existing assets, credentials & existing content
- Define milestones & budget using modules below
- Submit work proposal (with 3rd party items listed & a payments approval person)

#### STEP 2: Project set up ($1000)

- Get Credit Card
- Set up agency internal client folder (with asset list)
- Set up fileshare (dropbox?)
- Set up group calendar (google sheets is fine)
- Set up a task & communication tools (basecamp, slack, whatever) - stakeholders can observe progress
- Set up a credential tool (Lastpass) - project secure assets centralized
- Set up agency internal time tracking tools
- Set up repositories
- Set up temp (could be permanent) host

### STEP 3: Conversion strategy (4 weeks $4000+)

Note: Each one of these subsections is a deliverable and can be billed independently

#### On-site keyword optimization

Using SCM rush or google keyword tool to make sure the keywords you think people are searching for actually are.

? any other market research items at this point ?

#### Sales letter

The client needs to do this, not us; though, we can help if necessary. Sometimes its easier to organize a meeting and use a tape recorder as clients can often verbally describe their offering better than they can in a written document. In any case, get the client to outline a sales letter in which they forcefully list their offer.

Take this sales letter and build site-section identity for homepage, services, products, about, contact us (and whatever else). dont write complete copy now, just outline it (need a copywriter & keyword data before we write copy)

#### Customer profile briefs

Get reasonably detailed target audience segments from the client (customers, vendors, whatever). Use these segments to create an ideal customer profile brief (per segment). These don't need to be 10-page docs, they can be 1/3-page breakdowns so long as they're solid. 

Items to focus on include:

- What specifically are we trying to sell them
- Target wants & needs re conversion strategy
- Target geography, age, sex, status

#### Visitor workflow (in site & off of site)

Define how we intend to convert users in to leads by designing a workflow for each user segment. At least 2 methods per customer profile would be good (these are usually identical):

- Using the homepage to drive the customer (by profile) to the specific part of the website that's appropriate to them
- Landing on a content page to drive them to the part of the website that's appropriate to them

These can have on-page conversion (contact boxes, calls to action) or connected to the opt-in sections below.

#### Opt-in pages sales copy

Don't be afraid if this sounds complicated, it's just the copy that your using to grab someone’s attention to have them opt-in to some kind of high value to
downloadable content (white paper, guide, assembly thing, whatever). Obviously, the download items would need to be created too (though they might already exist internally).

This stuff can be combined with surveys to identify what clients want as value downloads (like after download pop up a survey that says "what would you like to see next").

#### Email auto responder series (relates to all conversion points)

Define the user path through email auto responders (scoped per target customer segment, different conversion funnel for each group), design the copy and assign to opt in items & visitor workflow above.

same deal if product and checkout are part of the need

same deal for forms

### STEP 4

Content, design and dev meet up to _get told_ the conversion strategy and be delivered relevant docs and user flows to guide each dept.

whole team creates a project site map then sets up tasks lists to determine who relies on who

### STEP 4-B: Content (2weeks * $1500+)

The bigest hurdle ive encountered when it comes to content is when cliens who need tonprovide it. its always late, slow, not formatted right, of poor quality, incomplete, etc. itd be nice to find a method to handle this, to decrease the potential risk overhead for clients who use their own copy and add predictability.

ideally, clients should only provide _existing_ content. All content that needs to be created should fall to us and billed for (whether outsourced or not). this will save a ton of time and keep the brand messaging on point.

in the rare case were not building any content but migrating content, we would still need an inventory and might need content creation if the sitemap is changing.

#### Conduct a content inventory (could add $1000)

- Current website
- Internal documentation
- Marketing / sales material
- Product catalogue
- anything else?

#### Voice & Tone guide (add 1-3k)

Optionally create and approve a voice and tone guide. The mailchimp style guide is a really good example of this.

Ideally written in markdown (VS Code has great error checking for syntax for newbies. Ghost might work too if self-hosted).

would need to add a dev task to build the thing, of course.

#### Site content creation - round 1

using the conversion strategy documents, sitemap, client flow, seo keyword analysis, voice and tone guides & existing client content, make a content package including the following.

Need to go over these numbers

- *Page copy* _350 words_ $200/page
- *Product copy* _100 words_ $100/page
- *Category copy* _100 words_ $100/page

?? Where do we create content? direct to the dev install? in markdown? word docs? Ghost?

there should be daily updates and links for clients to review. it should be clear to clients that catching contrnt architecture issues should come here, not later.

#### Content migrations (billed accordingly)

#### Media content

once design is approved, images can source/built and applied based on the design spec.

Custom photos & videos are the best (*find the margins we want)

Stock (pass-through 20%)
Custom (50-100% markup)

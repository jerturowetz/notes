# CULT Mtl :: Project road map

Hi Guys,

As promised, here is an updated version of the project details including priorities, goals, structure and timeline. We're going to be moving a lot of the details of this email in to a shared Google sheet as we move forward so feel free to review and advise if you'd like to make any revisions.

In order to save time our plan involves skipping items such as in-depth SEO analysis, outsources testing, advanced content migration, RSS feed structure, full reviews etc. As CULT Mtl currently manages a lot of these items internally we are assuming CULT Mtl will be able to fill in the gaps in order to ensue quality & stability moving forward (helping importing content, participating in review process).

Please note the actual pricing is not yet complete and any insight would be greatly appreciated on the design end of things.

## Project goals & considerations

- Visual redesign using the current CULT Mtl branding & concepts from the print layout
- Create design concepts to cover each of CULT Mtls unique page types
- Prioritize ease of navigation (navigation menus, categories, moving between posts)
- Consider technical aspects of implementing design concepts (editors picks, newsletter signup, related posts)
- Consider structured page tags, SEO & URLs
- Preserve current URL structure where possible

## Design timeline

- List page types (single post, single event)
- List module types (editors picks, newsletter signup, to-do list)
- Wireframe pages & define page components (author name, category reference, colors, images etc.)
- Assign modules to pages in wireframes & identify blockages
- Build preliminary sitemap using CULT Mtls current category structure & pages for reference
- Decide how to handle photo galleries (slideshow vs no slideshow, considering ad placement & mobile experience)
- Decide how to handle content loading for cats
- Decide how to handle print editions (PDFs for now)
- Decide how to handle Newsletter
- Apply the actual categories and custom types to the above skeleton in sketch form
- **Big review #1** during which we see if we missed anything and finalize a treelike sitemap
- Prototype page templates for articles: single posts, galleries & individual events
- Use sitemap to define site navigation
- Prototype navigation for desktop & mobile
- Add footer elements (but don’t worry too much about content for now)
- **Send to CULT Mtl for review 1.1** in which article templates & navigation are approved/finalized, footer is defined
- Finalize and apply suggestions/changes
- Finalize footer
- Prototype page templates for all endpoints (with assigned modules)
- **Send to CULT Mtl for review 1.2** in prep for meeting, only send any big issues
- **Big review #2** during which we review, amend & approve design concepts and make sure we didn’t miss any modules

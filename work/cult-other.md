# CULT Mtl :: Article Design

Top priority for the CULT Mtl redesign are articles by which I mean any single consumable item. This includes individual posts, galleries and single event listings.

All post bodies have the following information:

- Hero Image
- Breadcrumbs
- Title
- Subtitle
- Date
- Content

Posts can occasionally contain the following:

- blockquotes
- inline quotes
- Links to other site sections
- In-body photos (sometimes with caption)

Every post should also have:

- Advertisement blocks
- Related stories each consisting of a title, featured image and maybe a call to action. Optionally an excerpt - but im unsure if I want this.
- CULT Mtl logo
- Navigation or link to open Navigation
- Share links or link to open share options
- Call to action box









## Primary thoughts

- No sidebar on Articles, Events or Galleries
- Use the print layout as a style guide including:
  - same or similar fonts for headings and body (Google)
  - illuistrative boxes and black bars styles (there are a few of these)
  - lowercase/uppercase type use
- Add to the print layout with colors, unique presentation of links & type elements (blockquotes/captions)

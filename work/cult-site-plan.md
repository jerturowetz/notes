# CULT Mtl :: Site plan

Identifying all the potential page types, modules and user endpoints on the site is the first, most important task we'll have to tackle. Ideally this will be completed by the end of the week.

I'm going to review CULT Mtls current website and several other reference publications to make sure I didnâ€™t miss anything. Please also review and advise of any revisions you think might be required.

## Page types

- Single post (single photo, multiple photo)
- Single event
- Single gallery
- Category (sub cats or maybe use colors?, ads & related cats maybe)
- Events list
- Gallery list
- Tag / Author ?
- Best of MTL results
- Complex form page (i.e. vote for Best of Mtl)
- Home page
- _In this Issue_ page
- _Where to obtain_ page
- _To-do list_ page
- _Print editions_ page
- Other special pages (about / staff, rant-line, arts & culture)

## Modules

Some of these might not me necessary as modules if backed in to the navigation. This depends more on priority and global-view necessity.

- Related posts
- Related listings
- Related posts to galleries & vice versa
- The To-Do list
- _Get the print edition_
- _Sign up for the Newsletter_
- Best of MTL link
- Rantline
- Ads of defined sizes
- Identify posts from any issue (and have "in current issue")
- Main feature in a category
- Featured in sidebar vs as a page or section divider
- Suggested articles / most popular / Editors picks
- Full page popups
- Footer modules?

## Ad sizes

All four of the ad sizes appear on every page of the site

- Leaderboard (728 x 90)
- Big Box 1 (300 x 250)
- Big Box 2 (300 x 250)
- Skyscraper (160 x 600)

We can switch out to 2 expanded sizes:

- Expanded leaderboard (729 x 250)

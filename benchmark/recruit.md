Specify Job title
Specify Dev phase length
How the role would evolve at the go-to-market phase

We're in talks with JMSB, McGill CS and reaching out to several groups in montreal as this is a pretty unique position

(to work for less than our hires during dev)

But we're pretty cemeneted on this as we only want to attract people intersted & dedicated to gettin in on a technically creative and original project
and who would be in it for the long haul

Specificallu why I'm reaching out to you is that we're ooking for a woman or n individual who identifies as female. We only have one ofther female working equiy partner (out of 5) so far and having a female mind to guide the evolution of the technology is very important.

If you know anyone or a list of anyones who you think would be a good fit for this role
We're very interested in getting them to sign our NDA and giving the our elevator pitch
to get them as excited as we are

Thanks for you time!

# The post

Hi there,

I'm a member of a team currently looking for the final founding partner, specifically to lead back-end development on a platform we are building called Benchmark Me.

This person would have a managment role (defining the technologies & approach, overseeing a hired staff)

Ideally, this individual would be working part time for sweat equity during our develpment phase for 32 weeks from August; but could also get a hybrid of salary and sweat equity during this phase depending on needs. As this is a stragey position, we're looking for team members more than employees and someone to help drive the vision of our product (a really cool product, come sign our NDA and find out all about it).

Then we can specify a job title and description during the development phase, how that role would evolve at the go-to-market phase, with the possibility of a career path leading to CTO.

## Why I'm wrigint you

There's a very specific reason I'm reaching out to you - I'm not some recruiter, I'm the lead front end/full stack strategy partner on this project

and it's very important to me and the team that this position be filled by a woman or someone femme identifying as we're already too dude-heavy
so if you know of anyone who might be interested in this osition, would be willing to 
announce it at your meetups
or are willing to have me come and announce it so that I can Q&A
I'd appreciate it.

## Requirements

- 5+ years working as a back end developer or equivalent experience
- Experience managing small to medium sized dev teams (code reviews, designing tests, revision management, 1on1s)
- The ability to design, write and test high-quality code. You'll dictate what languages we use - we anticipate Python, Rust, Golang, MySQL, C but are open to whatever.
- Database management experience (sharding, retrieval techniques, scalable models, security, etc)
- Experience working with Linux environments, resilient and scalable platforms are an asset (we are NOT open to .net)
- Experience working in a continuous integration environment with unit tests and automated tests as part of the development flow
- Experience with real time data processing and modelling (and Elastisearch would be good too)
- Experience integrating machine learning pipelines for data grouping and interpretation (you don't need to be an R wizard, but having worked with some would be an asset)
- Experience designing with infrastructure in mind (AWS Console, RDS, EC2, S3, bucket, CloudFormation, DynamoDB)
- The other usual stuff like having a solid grasp of REST, AGILE, ticketing techniques for easy team management
- Bilingual an asset
- Front end experience (javascript, react, whatever) an asset to facilitate with the front end team
- Female/Trans an asset

I would lead like this - We're looking for the final founding partner to lead back-end development on a new platform we are building called Benchmark Me. Then we can specify a job title and description during the development phase, how that role would evolve at the go-to-market phase, with the possibility of a career path leading to CTO.

He would be in addition to "your counterpart on the back-end", who we still want as an equity partner, but could also get a hybrid of salary and sweat equity.



I was hanging out with a senior designer at Ubisoft over the weekend who has an uncle who might be available. He is an architect who has worked for two multinationals doing database BI.

• Database management experience (sharding, retrieval techniques, scalable models, security, etc)
• Experience working with Linux environments, resilient and scalable platforms are an asset (we are NOT open to .net)
• Experience working in a continuous integration environment with unit tests and automated tests as part of the development flow
• Experience with real time data processing and modelling (and Elastisearch would be good too)
• Experience integrating machine learning pipelines for data grouping and interpretation (you don't need to be an R wizard, but having worked with some would be an asset)
• Experience designing with infrastructure in mind (AWS Console, RDS, EC2, S3, bucket, CloudFormation, DynamoDB)
• The other usual stuff like having a solid grasp of REST, AGILE, ticketing techniques for easy team management
• Bilingual an asset

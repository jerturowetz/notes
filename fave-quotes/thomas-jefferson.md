# Thomas Jefferson

> I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.

> Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.

> Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.

> Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear.

> He who knows nothing is closer to the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.

> A coward is much more exposed to quarrels than a man of spirit.
